# Policy Analysis: drk_technical_impossibility_policy

## Original Policy
All digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository must be simultaneously encrypted with AES-256 for security and stored as plaintext to enable full-text indexing. The system must maintain a single copy of each file that satisfies both requirements without any transformation during retrieval.

Original Policy Statement
──────────────────────────────
"All digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository must be simultaneously encrypted with AES-256 for security and stored as plaintext to enable full-text indexing. The system must maintain a single copy of each file that satisfies both requirements without any transformation during retrieval."

──────────────────────────────
Policy Analysis Summary
──────────────────────────────
• Policy Type: Set  
  – (There is no explicit assigner or assignee mentioned; the policy simply “sets” a requirement.)

• Rule Type: Obligation  
  – (The text uses “must” to require specific actions.)

• Actions:
  – Encrypt each digital artifact using AES-256.
  – Store each digital artifact as plaintext for full-text indexing.
  – Maintain a single copy of each file that meets both of the above criteria without any transformation during retrieval.

• Actors:
  – Implied Assigner: The authority managing the DRK Cultural Heritage repository.
  – Implied Assignee: The repository system responsible for handling and storing the digital artifacts.

• Target Assets:
  – Digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository.

Issues Detected
──────────────────────────────
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - The requirement to have the digital artifact “simultaneously encrypted” and “stored as plaintext” is inherently non-measurable because it conflicts with itself.  
     • Explanation: Standards like AES-256 encryption produce ciphertext, which is not plaintext. Requiring both states at the same time is impossible to measure or verify in a real system.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - There are no additional vague action verbs; the actions are stated clearly (encrypt with AES-256, store as plaintext).  
     • Nonetheless, the core conflict between “encrypted” and “plaintext” makes the actions semantically vague in terms of practical implementation.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No explicit time windows, start times, or end times are provided in the policy.  
     • Therefore, no temporal contradictions were detected.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No location-based rules or hierarchies are mentioned in the policy.  
     • Therefore, no location conflicts apply.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy does not specify if the digital artifacts have distinct file formats, versions, or categories which might require different handling.
   - Recommendation: Clarify the scope of digital artifacts (e.g., file types or metadata) for better practical guidance.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy does not define how or when the encryption process is applied nor the process by which plaintext is derived for indexing.
   - Recommendation: Provide activation conditions or technical procedures detailing when and how transformations occur.

7. Conflict Issues:
   - There is a direct logical contradiction: the requirement to simultaneously be stored as ciphertext (due to AES-256 encryption) and as plaintext (for full-text indexing) is mutually exclusive.
   - This conflict makes implementation technically impossible.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - No explicit or implicit hierarchy issues exist regarding location or role hierarchies.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - The policy is impractical because it mandates an impossible state—files cannot be both encrypted (concealing content) and stored in plaintext (exposing content) simultaneously.
   - The “single copy” requirement further limits any possibility to derive a secure yet indexable version of the file.
   - This conflict violates basic principles of digital security and data management.

Decision
──────────────────────────────
Status: REJECTED

Rationale:
• The policy contains a direct contradiction by requiring digital artifacts to be both encrypted with AES-256 and stored as plaintext without any transformation. This mutually exclusive condition makes it impossible to implement in any real-world system, thereby triggering the rejection criteria.

──────────────────────────────
Alternative Policy
──────────────────────────────
Below is a rewritten alternative that addresses the issues and is feasible to implement:

"All digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository must be stored in an encrypted state using AES-256 to ensure security. For full-text indexing purposes, the system must dynamically decrypt files during the indexing process without permanently storing a plaintext copy. The repository shall maintain one secure (encrypted) copy of each digital artifact, while safe temporary decryption should only occur during indexing operations governed by strict access controls and audit logging. Post-indexing, no plaintext version of the artifact shall be retained on disk."

──────────────────────────────
Improvement Suggestions
──────────────────────────────
• Clarify Asset Scope: Define exactly which types of digital artifacts (file formats, sizes, metadata) are covered by the policy.  
• Specify Process Triggers: Indicate when and how encryption and decryption occur (e.g., during ingestion, on-demand for indexing).  
• Strengthen Access Controls: Detail security measures around temporary decryption during indexing with precise activation conditions and audit trails to ensure compliance with security standards.  
• Documentation: Provide additional documentation or guidelines that detail the hardware and software requirements needed to support dynamic decryption securely.

──────────────────────────────
Analysis and Reasoning Summary
──────────────────────────────
The central issue with the original policy is the irreconcilable conflict between the encryption and plaintext storage requirements. This critical semantic contradiction makes the policy technically and practically unimplementable, triggering an immediate rejection. The alternative policy provided redirects the intended security and indexing functionality into a logically consistent, real-world implementable solution.
