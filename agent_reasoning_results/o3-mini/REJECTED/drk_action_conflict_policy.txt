## Original Policy Statement
"Researchers can modify metadata in the Cultural Heritage Dataset for academic purposes. any metadata must not modify in the Cultural Heritage Dataset."

------------------------------------------------------------
## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Set (defining rules for researchers regarding metadata modification)
- Rule Type:
   • First sentence: Permission (Researchers can modify metadata for academic purposes)
   • Second sentence: Prohibition (Metadata must not be modified)
- Actions: 
   • Modify metadata in the Cultural Heritage Dataset
- Actors: 
   • Assignee: Researchers (a defined role)
   • Assigner: Implicit authority governing the dataset (unspecified)
- Target Assets: 
   • Metadata in the Cultural Heritage Dataset

------------------------------------------------------------
## Issues Detected

1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - The phrase "for academic purposes" is a non-measurable, qualitative constraint. It lacks clear criteria or definitions (e.g., what qualifies as an academic purpose).
     • Why it's non-measurable: There are no specific criteria, guidelines, or thresholds established to determine when a modification qualifies as for academic purposes.
     • Violation: This ambiguity can lead to inconsistent interpretation and enforcement.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - The term "modify metadata" is used redundantly with contradictory directives. The action is not further detailed.
     • Why it's vague: There is no specification regarding the scope, extent, or nature of the modifications allowed or prohibited.
     • Violation: The vague nature of the allowed modification, when directly countered by a prohibition, creates an unresolvable directive.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No explicit time windows or temporal constraints have been defined.
   - There are no overlapping time periods given; thus, no temporal contradiction is detected.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No location-based constraints or hierarchies are mentioned. There are no location conflicts.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - Ambiguity in the allowed purpose ("academic purposes") without clear measurable criteria.
   - Ambiguity between permission and prohibition regarding the same action on the same asset.
   - Recommendation: Clearly define what qualifies as an academic purpose and remove contradictory statements.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy does not specify any activation triggers, enumerated procedures, or obligations (e.g., approval processes) to modify metadata responsibly.
   - Note: Clarity on controlling authorities or guidelines would improve the policy.

7. Conflict Issues:
   - The policy exhibits an inherent contradiction: It grants permission to modify metadata while simultaneously imposing a blanket prohibition on any modification.
   - This logical conflict makes the policy impossible to implement as stated.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - No explicit role or location hierarchies are provided beyond identifying researchers as the allowed actor.
   - No other hierarchy issues identified.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - The inherent contradiction (granting permission and imposition of prohibition on the same action) makes practical enforcement impossible.
   - The use of non-measurable terms (e.g., "academic purposes") without limitations or clear definitions complicates compliance and oversight.
   - The policy, as written, would create confusion about what modifications are allowed, likely leading to enforcement problems and potential security risks during metadata management.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Decision
- Status: REJECTED
- Rationale: The policy presents a direct and unresolvable contradiction by simultaneously permitting and prohibiting metadata modification on the same asset by the same group (researchers). Additionally, the term "for academic purposes" is non-measurable without clear criteria. These issues, combined with vague directives and inherent logical conflict, render the policy non-implementable in a real-world setting.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Alternative Policy
"Researchers are allowed to modify metadata in the Cultural Heritage Dataset exclusively for clearly defined academic research purposes. Such modifications are permitted only after obtaining prior approval from the Cultural Heritage Dataset Governance Board and must comply with the official metadata editing guidelines. All modifications must be fully documented and subject to periodic review to ensure they preserve the integrity and accuracy of the original dataset."

------------------------------------------------------------
## Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly define what constitutes "academic purposes" by specifying criteria or providing examples.
- Remove contradictory statements by adopting a single, coherent rule regarding metadata modification.
- Establish an approval or review process (e.g., requiring permission from a designated authority) to manage modifications.
- Enforce documentation and review requirements to ensure ongoing oversight and integrity of the dataset.
- Provide measurable guidelines and constraints to avoid ambiguity and ensure the policy can be reliably implemented and enforced.
