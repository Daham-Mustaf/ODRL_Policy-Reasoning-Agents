## Original Policy Statement
"Museum curators may approve or deny requests to reproduce images from the Digital Cultural Heritage Collection. Requests approved by curators will be forwarded to the Rights Management Department for processing."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Set  
  (This is a defined set of rules regarding the reproduction of images.)
- Rule Type: Permission  
  (Curators are allowed to approve or deny requests, and approved requests are transferred for processing.)
- Actions:
  • Approve requests  
  • Deny requests  
  • Forward approved requests to the Rights Management Department for processing
- Actors:
  • Assignee: Museum curators (responsible for evaluating and deciding on requests)  
  • Assigner/Recipient for further processing: Rights Management Department (handles approved requests)
- Target Assets:
  • Images from the Digital Cultural Heritage Collection

## Issues Detected
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None.  
     • All constraints are directly related to the action outcomes (approval/denial and forwarding) without non-measurable terms.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None.  
     • The actions (approval, denial, and forwarding for processing) are clearly defined and specific.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None.  
     • There are no time windows or temporal conditions specified that could lead to overlaps or conflicts.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None.  
     • No locations or geographical hierarchies are mentioned in the policy.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - None.  
     • The policy clearly specifies who (museum curators) may take which actions (approve or deny and forward) on which assets (images from the Digital Cultural Heritage Collection).

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - None.  
     • All parties, actions, and assets are clearly defined.

7. Conflict Issues:
   - None.  
     • There are no circular dependencies or conflicting instructions; the process is straightforward.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - None.  
     • There are no conflicting hierarchies for locations or roles.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - None.  
     • The policy is clear, specific, and implementable in a real-world setting. There are no overly broad or vague universal qualifiers, and the actions are concrete.

## Decision
- Status: APPROVED
- Rationale:  
  The policy is clear, specific, and actionable. All parties, actions, and target assets are well defined, and there are no non-measurable constraints, vague actions, temporal or location conflicts, or logical contradictions. The process is straightforward and ready for practical implementation without any significant issues.

## Alternative Policy
(Not applicable, as the policy is APPROVED.)

## Improvement Suggestions
(No improvements are necessary since the policy meets all the defined criteria for clarity, specificity, and implementability.)
