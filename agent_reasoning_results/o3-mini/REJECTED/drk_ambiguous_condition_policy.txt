# Policy Analysis: drk_ambiguous_condition_policy

## Original Policy
If researchers submit access requests for restricted manuscripts, then curators will review the request. If the request is approved, users can download high-resolution images. If the request is urgent, it will be expedited.

## Expected Decision

## Original Policy Statement
"If researchers submit access requests for restricted manuscripts, then curators will review the request. If the request is approved, users can download high-resolution images. If the request is urgent, it will be expedited."

--------------------------------------------------

## Policy Analysis Summary
• Policy Type: Set  
• Rule Type:  
 – Obligation: Curators must review submitted access requests.  
 – Permission: Users are allowed to download high-resolution images provided the request is approved.  
 – Conditional Modifier: If a request is urgent, it will receive expedited processing.  

• Actions:  
 – Submit access requests (performed by researchers)  
 – Review the request (performed by curators)  
 – Download high-resolution images (allowed for users after approval)  
 – Expedite processing (applied when a request is categorized as urgent)  

• Actors:  
 – Researchers: Initiate the process by submitting access requests.  
 – Curators: Obligated to review access requests.  
 – Users: Granted permission to download high-resolution images upon approval (note: the usage of “researchers” versus “users” is inconsistent).  

• Target Assets:  
 – Restricted manuscripts  
 – High-resolution images (the connection between these assets is not clearly defined)

--------------------------------------------------

## Issues Detected

1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):  
 • "Urgent" is subjective and non-measurable – there is no explicit definition or quantifiable criteria for what constitutes an urgent request. This makes enforcement ambiguous and violates the requirement for measurable temporal constraints.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):  
 • The term "expedite" is used without a defined timeframe or clear process, which makes it a vague action.  
 • The policy uses both "researchers" and "users" in a way that creates ambiguity about who is allowed to perform or benefit from certain actions.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):  
 • No explicit temporal windows are provided; however, the absence of measurable timeframes (especially for expedited processing) introduces ambiguity in operational timing.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):  
 • There are no location-based requirements mentioned, so no issues of conflict in this category are present.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):  
 • The policy inconsistently refers to parties as “researchers” and “users” without clearly delineating their roles.  
 • The relationship between the “restricted manuscripts” and “high-resolution images” is not clearly defined – it is unclear if the images are derived from the manuscripts or are separate assets.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):  
 • Lacks measurable criteria and clear definition for what qualifies as an “urgent” request.  
 • Does not clearly articulate the specific responsibilities and distinctions among the roles mentioned.

7. Conflict Issues:  
 • No circular dependency or logical contradiction is identified in the sequence of actions.

8. Hierarchy Violations:  
 • No explicit role or location hierarchy issues are detected beyond the ambiguity in party naming.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:  
 • The lack of measurable criteria for “urgent” requests and expedited processing may result in inconsistent application.  
 • The ambiguity between “researchers” and “users” could cause confusion regarding who is eligible for what actions, potentially hindering enforcement.  
 • The unclear definition of asset relationships might affect the accuracy of access controls in a real-world system.

--------------------------------------------------

## Decision
- Status: NEEDS REVISION  
- Rationale: While the policy outlines a generally plausible workflow, it suffers from moderate issues that hinder precise implementation. The ambiguity in role definitions (researchers vs. users), the non-measurable nature of the “urgent” condition, and the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between the restricted manuscripts and high-resolution images necessitate revision. These moderate issues should be addressed to ensure enforceability and clear operational guidelines without triggering outright rejection.

--------------------------------------------------

## Alternative Policy
[Not applicable, as the final decision is NEEDS REVISION rather than REJECTED.]

--------------------------------------------------

## Improvement Suggestions
• Define Criteria for "Urgent":  
 – Clearly specify what conditions or thresholds qualify a request as urgent (for example, "urgent" means that a request must be processed within 2 business hours if it is marked with a priority flag and meets pre-defined criteria).

• Consistent Role Definitions:  
 – Use consistent terminology to refer to the parties involved. For instance, if "researchers" are the ones submitting requests, then they should also be the ones who receive the download permissions. Alternatively, explicitly define the difference between “researchers” (submitters) and “users” (recipients).

• Clarify Asset Relationships:  
 – Explicitly state whether high-resolution images are derived from the restricted manuscripts or if they represent separate assets. This clarification would ensure that access controls are applied to the correct resources.

• Specify Timelines for Actions:  
 – Include measurable timeframes for each step (e.g., “Curators will review each submitted request within 48 hours” and “Upon approval, users may download the high-resolution images within a 7-day window”).

By addressing these suggestions, the policy can be refined to be more explicit, measurable, and enforceable in a real-world setting.
