Below is the complete analysis based on the policy statement.

──────────────────────────────
Original Policy Statement
──────────────────────────────
"Nobody can do anything."

──────────────────────────────
Policy Analysis Summary
──────────────────────────────
• Policy Type: Set  
 – This is a standalone statement that sets a rule rather than an agreement, offer, or request.

• Rule Type: Prohibition  
 – It forbids every possible action.

• Actions:  
 – "do" (in the phrase “do anything”)  
  • The action is extremely vague and non-measurable.

• Actors:  
 – Assignee (the actor affected by the rule): "nobody" (a universal quantifier meaning every potential actor)  
 – Assigner: Implicit (the source of the rule is not explicitly defined)

• Target Assets:  
 – None are specified  
  • There is no indication what resource, data, or item this prohibition applies to.

Issues Detected
──────────────────────────────
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - Issue: The phrases “nobody” and “do anything” are non-measurable constraints.
     • Explanation: Both terms lack specificity and measurable criteria (e.g., which users, what actions), making enforcement impossible.
  
2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - Issue: The action “do anything” is extremely vague.
     • Explanation: “Do anything” does not define any observable, specific action with a clear beginning or end, which violates the requirement for precisely measurable actions.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No temporal constraints or specified time windows are included.  
     • Explanation: There are no overlapping or conflicting time periods; thus, this category is not applicable.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No geographic or location-based rules are mentioned.  
     • Explanation: With no locations defined, there is no conflict in location context.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - Issue: The lack of explicit parties (assigner and assignee) and omission of target assets make the policy ambiguous.
     • Recommendation: Clearly identify who the rule applies to and what assets or data are being protected.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - Issue: The statement does not include target assets or any measurable constraints.
     • Recommendation: Introduce specific assets (e.g., “user data,” “financial records”) and clearly define the scope of the prohibition.

7. Conflict Issues:
   - Issue: The statement logically contradicts itself by prohibiting every action by every actor.
     • Explanation: A universal prohibition (“nobody can do anything”) is unrealistic and inherently contradictory to the need for actions to occur in any operational environment.
   - CRITICAL - CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY CHECK:  
     • There are no dependency loops in this statement.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - No explicit role or location hierarchy is provided.
     • Explanation: Since roles and locations are not defined, there are no hierarchical conflicts to address.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - Issue: The use of universal quantifiers (“nobody” and “anything”) without any scope limitations is overly broad.
     • Explanation: Such guidelines are neither practical nor enforceable as they prevent any actionable operation. This violates basic principles for creating enforceable rules.

──────────────────────────────
Decision
──────────────────────────────
Status: REJECTED

Rationale:  
• The policy employs vague, non-measurable constraints (“do anything”) and universal terms (“nobody”) without defining any clear assets or a scope of actors.  
• These factors create an inherently contradictory and unrealistic rule that cannot be implemented or enforced in any real-world setting.

──────────────────────────────
Alternative Policy
──────────────────────────────
Below is a rewritten alternative that addresses the identified issues and is feasible to implement:

"Only authorized personnel may perform specified operations on designated system resources. Specifically, only members of the System Administration Group are permitted to modify system configurations and access system logs. All other users are strictly prohibited from modifying system configurations or accessing system logs. These restrictions apply at all times unless explicitly overridden by a documented maintenance procedure approved by senior management."

Key improvements in this alternative:
 • Clearly identifies the actors (“authorized personnel,” “members of the System Administration Group” vs. “all other users”).  
 • Specifies target assets (“system configurations,” “system logs”).  
 • Defines measurable, specific actions (“modify,” “access”).  
 • Includes a conditional exception with a defined approval process (“documented maintenance procedure approved by senior management”), providing real-world flexibility without using vague or universal restrictions.

──────────────────────────────
Improvement Suggestions
──────────────────────────────
• Clearly define all parties and stakeholders:  
 – Specify the assigner and the assignee.  
 – Replace universal quantifiers (“nobody,” “anything”) with specific groups or roles.

• Identify Target Assets:  
 – Clearly state which resources, data, or system components are covered by the policy.

• Use Measurable and Observable Actions:  
 – Replace vague verbs with action verbs that have clear, measurable criteria (e.g., “modify,” “access,” “delete”).

• Avoid Overly Broad Prohibitions:  
 – Instead of an all-encompassing prohibition, set explicit conditions under which actions are allowed and prohibited.

• Introduce Contextual or Conditional Exceptions:  
 – If necessary, outline exceptions or specific conditions (such as maintenance windows or special authorization procedures) to allow necessary operations while still enforcing strict controls.

By applying these improvements, policies remain clear, enforceable, and aligned with real-world operational and security requirements.
