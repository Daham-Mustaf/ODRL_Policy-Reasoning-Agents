## Original Policy Statement
"The track is available only after 2025, but it can also be used in 2024 for educational purposes."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Set (a collection of rules without clearly defined assigner or assignee roles)
- Rule Type: Permission with a regulatory constraint (dictates when the asset is available/usable)
- Actions:
  - “Available” – the track is available only after 2025
  - “Used” – the track can be used in 2024 for educational purposes
- Actors:
  - Not explicitly defined (no clear assigner or assignee specified)
- Target Assets:
  - The track

## Issues Detected
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No non-measurable constraints were identified in terms like “business hours” or vague quantifiers.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No vague actions were detected; the actions “available” and “used” are reasonably specific in context.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - Overlapping Time Windows with Contradictory Requirements:
     • Constraint 1: “Only after 2025” implies the track is not accessible before 2025.
     • Constraint 2: “Can also be used in 2024 for educational purposes” implies an exception allowing use before 2025.
     • Explanation: These two temporal conditions conflict because they simultaneously disallow and allow usage in overlapping time windows (specifically, the year 2024), creating an irreconcilable contradiction.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None – there are no location-based constraints present.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy does not clearly define the roles (assigner and assignee) or how educational usage in 2024 is governed aside from the temporal conflict.
   
6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - Missing explicit details regarding parties responsible for the decision and any additional conditions or guidelines for the educational use exception.

7. Conflict Issues:
   - Direct logical conflict: The track’s availability is limited to after 2025, yet an exception permits its use in 2024. There is no clear condition indicating how these contradictory conditions should be reconciled.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - None identified concerning location or role hierarchies.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - The conflicting temporal rules make it impossible to determine the correct state (accessible or inaccessible) during the overlapping period (2024), rendering the policy infeasible for real-world implementation.

## Decision
- Status: REJECTED
- Rationale: The policy contains overlapping temporal conditions that directly contradict each other—disallowing general access before 2025 while simultaneously permitting educational use in 2024. This irreconcilable conflict makes the policy impossible to implement.

## Alternative Policy
"The track is available solely after 2025 for all purposes. Educational use of the track may be permitted from 2026 onwards, provided that a formal application is submitted and approved under the Educational Access Program guidelines."

## Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly define the temporal boundaries without overlap to avoid contradictions.
- Specify any exceptions for special use cases (such as educational purposes) with unambiguous conditions and activation dates.
- Include clear definitions for the involved parties (assigner and assignee) and establish guidelines or processes (such as application and approval procedures) if exceptions are allowed.
- Ensure that the time windows do not contradict; if an exception is necessary, adjust the time periods so that no usage is allowed before the asset is generally available.
