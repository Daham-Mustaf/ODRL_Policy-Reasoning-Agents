## Original Policy Statement
"Everyone can access everything."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Set
- Rule Type: Permission
- Actions: "access"
- Actors: Assignee – "Everyone" (universal); Assigner – Implicit authority (unspecified)
- Target Assets: "everything" (unspecified and all-encompassing)

## Issues Detected
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - The use of "Everyone" is a non-measurable constraint because it does not specify which individuals are included or excluded (e.g., employees, contractors, external users).
   - The reference to "everything" is non-measurable since it offers no specific indication of which assets or resources are under consideration (e.g., systems, data, records, etc.).
   - These non-measurable constraints make the policy overly broad and lack clear boundaries, violating requirements for specificity and enforceability.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - The action "access" is vague since it does not define the type of access (e.g., read, write, execute, manage), the conditions under which access is granted, or any contextual limitations.
   - As a result, the policy does not provide clear, actionable criteria for enforcement or monitoring, which violates implementation requirements.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No time periods or schedules are mentioned; however, this absence contributes to the overall vagueness and non-measurability of the policy.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - There are no location-based specifications provided, so no direct conflicts exist here. However, the lack of location context contributes to the overall lack of constraint.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy is ambiguous regarding which resources are being accessed and under what conditions.
   - Recommendation: Clearly define asset types (e.g., databases, documents, networks) and specify the nature of the access (e.g., read, write, modify).

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy does not delineate any restrictions, exceptions, or conditions (e.g., time frames, location, roles) for access, making it incomplete.
   - Recommendation: Introduce constraints such as role-based access control, time restrictions, device requirements, or contextual limitations.

7. Conflict Issues:
   - There are no explicit temporal or spatial conflicts, but the policy’s universal allowance is inherently incompatible with security principles.
   - CRITICAL - CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY CHECK: No circular dependencies are present.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - No explicit role or location hierarchies are mentioned; however, the absence of any hierarchical structure contributes to the lack of specificity.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - The use of universal quantifiers "everyone" and "everything" makes the policy impractical for enforcement, as it grants unrestricted access without any security, privacy, or regulatory constraints.
   - This level of unrestricted access violates basic security principles and would likely compromise organizational security, privacy standards, and compliance regulations.
   - Such universal access is fundamentally incompatible with real-world security implementations, triggering an immediate rejection.

## Decision
- Status: REJECTED
- Rationale: The policy "Everyone can access everything." is overly broad and uses non-measurable, universal quantifiers for both actors and assets without providing any specific limitations. The vague action "access" lacks definable parameters, making the policy unenforceable, impractical, and a direct violation of basic security principles.

## Alternative Policy
"Authorized personnel are granted access to designated assets according to their roles and departmental requirements. Specifically, employees of the Finance Department may access financial records during business hours (9:00 AM – 5:00 PM EST, Monday through Friday) via secure, authenticated systems. Any requests for access outside these parameters must undergo a formal approval process by the Security Manager."

## Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly define the actor scope by specifying which groups (e.g., employees, contractors) are considered when granting access.
- Specify target assets precisely (e.g., databases, financial records, system files) instead of using the term "everything."
- Detail the type of access being allowed (e.g., read, write, modify) and include any operational constraints or conditions (such as time-of-day restrictions or location-based access).
- Include an approval or audit process for exceptions to ensure that access remains controlled and compliant with security policies.
- Ensure that all quantifiers are limited to measurable, enforceable criteria to support clear, practical implementation.
