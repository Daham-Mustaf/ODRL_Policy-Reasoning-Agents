# Policy Analysis: drk_uc4_conflicting_use_policy

## Original Policy
The Daten Raumkultur project (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/) offers a contract for accessing the dataset (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234), permitting the named UC4 Partner to use the dataset up to 30 times. However, the same policy also permits the UC4 Partner to access the dataset without any usage limitations.

## Expected Decision

Section: Original Policy Statement
------------------------------------------------------------
"The Daten Raumkultur project (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/) offers a contract for accessing the dataset (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234), permitting the named UC4 Partner to use the dataset up to 30 times.

Section: Policy Analysis Summary
------------------------------------------------------------
• Policy Type: Agreement  
   - Assigner: Daten Raumkultur project  
   - Assignee: Named UC4 Partner  

• Rule Type: Permission  

• Actions:  
   - Access or use the dataset  
   - Two distinct permissions are granted: one that limits usage up to 30 times and another that allows unlimited access  

• Actors:  
   - Assigner: Daten Raumkultur project (the provider offering the contract)  
   - Assignee: UC4 Partner (the recipient allowed to access the dataset)  

• Target Assets:  
   - The dataset identified by http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234

------------------------------------------------------------
Section: Issues Detected
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):  
   - No non-measurable constraints were detected; the quantitative limit of "30 times" is clearly measurable.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):  
   - There are no vague actions in terms of what “access” or “use” entails. However, the policy offers contradictory permissions which impact the clear definition of the action’s limits.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):  
   - No explicit time windows or temporal boundaries are specified in the policy.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):  
   - No location-based rules or conflicts are present.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):  
   - The policy is ambiguous regarding which of the two permissions should prevail. It is unclear whether the allowance up to "30 times" is a general rule that is subsequently overridden by an exception of unlimited access, or if these two permissions apply under different conditions.  
   - Recommendation: Clarify the intent by specifying the conditions under which each permission applies.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):  
   - The policy lacks clarification on whether the unlimited access clause supersedes or is mutually exclusive with the 30-times limit clause.  
   - Recommendation: Include details to avoid ambiguity regarding the permitted usage.

7. Conflict Issues:  
   - The primary logical conflict is a direct contradiction: one clause limits dataset access to 30 times while another clause permits unlimited access for the same actor, on the same asset, and for the same action.
   - This contradiction creates a clear semantic conflict that renders the policy unimplementable.

8. Hierarchy Violations:  
   - No specific location or role hierarchy issues were identified in the policy.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:  
   - Because the policy simultaneously mandates both a hard quantitative limit (30 times) and unlimited usage, there is no clear, enforceable rule regarding how often the dataset may be accessed.  
   - This contradictory permission setup could lead to inconsistent enforcement and security issues in a real-world context.
   - As a universal issue, allowing unlimited access without proper scope and without resolving the conflict violates practical implementation constraints.

------------------------------------------------------------
Section: Decision
------------------------------------------------------------
Status: REJECTED

Rationale: The policy contains a critical semantic contradiction—a direct and unresolvable conflict wherein the UC4 Partner is permitted both limited access (up to 30 times) and unlimited access to the same dataset. This contradiction makes the policy logically inconsistent and impossible to implement in any real-world enforcement scenario.

------------------------------------------------------------
Section: Alternative Policy
------------------------------------------------------------
Proposed Revised Policy Statement:

"The Daten Raumkultur project (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/) offers a contract for accessing the dataset (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234) to the named UC4 Partner. Under this contract, the UC4 Partner is permitted to access the dataset a maximum of 30 times. Any access requests beyond the 30 allowed times are not permitted unless a separate authorization is granted."

This alternative removes the contradictory unlimited permission and establishes one clear, measurable constraint on dataset access.

------------------------------------------------------------
Section: Improvement Suggestions
------------------------------------------------------------
• Clarify Permission Scope:  
   - Clearly specify the conditions under which the dataset may be accessed. Avoid adding multiple contradictory clauses for the same action and actor.  
   - If multiple levels of access are desired (e.g., standard access and an exceptional unlimited access), define separate conditions and triggers for each level.

• Eliminate Ambiguity:  
   - Remove any clauses that are mutually exclusive. In this case, choose either a limited-access model (e.g., "up to 30 times") or an unlimited-access model and document the criteria and conditions for that decision.

• Enhance Completeness:  
   - Include any relevant contextual parameters such as effective dates, duration of the contract, and procedures for seeking additional access beyond the defined limit if needed.
