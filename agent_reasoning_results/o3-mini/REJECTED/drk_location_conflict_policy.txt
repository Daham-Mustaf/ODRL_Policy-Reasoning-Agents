# Policy Analysis: drk_location_conflict_policy

## Original Policy
Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted exclusively within Germany, for approved researchers. However, access is prohibited in all locations outside of Germany, including all European countries. This creates a conflict as the dataset is accessible in Germany but completely restricted across Europe, which contradicts the expected availability within the European Union.

## Expected Decision

Original Policy Statement

Policy Analysis Summary
──────────────────────────────
• Policy Type: SET – This policy defines rules regarding where access is permitted or prohibited.
  
• Rule Type:
 – Permission: Access is permitted for approved researchers within Germany.
 – Prohibition: Access is prohibited in all locations outside Germany (explicitly including all European countries).

• Actions:
 – Action: "access" (the rule governs access to the dataset).

• Actors:
 – Assignee (the subjects of the rule): approved researchers.
 – Assigner (implied policy enforcer or data owner, though not explicitly named).

• Target Assets:
 – The "Cultural Heritage Dataset."

Issues Detected
──────────────────────────────
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No non-measurable constraints were identified (all geographic constraints are explicitly stated).

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No vague actions. The only action “access” is clearly defined.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - There are no temporal (time-based) constraints given, so no timing conflicts exist.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - Conflicting Location Requirements:
       • The policy permits access within Germany.
       • The policy prohibits access in all locations outside Germany, explicitly including all European countries.
       • Conflict: Since Germany is a part of Europe, the clause prohibiting access in European countries directly contradicts the permission granted to approved researchers in Germany.
   - This contradiction makes the policy logically inconsistent and unimplementable.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - No significant ambiguities in terms of parties or actions beyond the location conflict have been identified.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - All required elements (asset, actors, actions) are mentioned; however, the contradictory geographic restrictions render the overall intent unclear.

7. Conflict Issues:
   - The geographic rules are in clear conflict:
       • Granted access in Germany versus prohibited access in Europe (which includes Germany).
   - This represents a direct logical conflict that prevents any real-world implementation.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - Location Hierarchy Violation:
       • Germany is an integral part of Europe. Thus, granting access to Germany while denying it for Europe is inherently contradictory.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - The policy, as stated, is unimplementable in the real world because the contradictory geographic instructions (access allowed in Germany but denied for all European countries) cannot be reconciled.
   - This contradiction would lead to an enforcement scenario where approved researchers in Germany would both have access and be denied access simultaneously.

Decision
──────────────────────────────
Status: REJECTED

Rationale:
The policy must be immediately rejected because of a critical semantic contradiction. The location-based rules conflict irreconcilably—Germany, while designated as the allowed location, is a part of Europe, yet the policy prohibits access across all European countries. This violation of geographic hierarchy makes the policy impossible to implement in a real-world setting.

──────────────────────────────
Alternative Policy
──────────────────────────────
Rewritten Alternative Policy:

"Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted exclusively to approved researchers who are physically located within the Federal Republic of Germany. Access from any location outside Germany is prohibited. Note: This policy applies solely within the recognized political boundaries of Germany."

──────────────────────────────
Improvement Suggestions
──────────────────────────────
• Remove overlapping geographic restrictions that create inherent contradictions. Ensure that permissions and prohibitions do not conflict due to geographical hierarchies (e.g., stating rules for a country and a continent that contains that country).
  
• Clearly define the allowed region without including contradictory prohibitions that cover the same region by virtue of its hierarchical placement.
  
• If broader regional restrictions are desired, explicitly separate rules to avoid overlap. For example, if the aim were to permit access only in Germany while denying access in other European jurisdictions, clarify the policy by stating, “Access is granted solely within the boundaries of Germany; all other territories, including non-German regions in Europe, are excluded.”

• Always verify that roles, actions, and assets are clearly defined and that any constraints are logically coherent and feasible for practical enforcement.
