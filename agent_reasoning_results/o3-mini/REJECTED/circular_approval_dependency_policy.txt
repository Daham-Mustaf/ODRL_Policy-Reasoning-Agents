# Policy Analysis: circular_approval_dependency_policy

## Original Policy
External researchers may access the Historical Manuscripts Archive only after receiving approval from the Archives Committee. The Archives Committee may grant access only after reviewing the researcher's publication history, which must be verified by the Digital Rights Department. The Digital Rights Department may only perform verification after the researcher has been granted preliminary access to submit their credentials through the Archive Access Portal.

Original Policy Statement
──────────────────────────────
"External researchers may access the Historical Manuscripts Archive only after receiving approval from the Archives Committee. The Archives Committee may grant access only after reviewing the researcher's publication history, which must be verified by the Digital Rights Department. The Digital Rights Department may only perform verification after the researcher has been granted preliminary access to submit their credentials through the Archive Access Portal."

Policy Analysis Summary
──────────────────────────────
• Policy Type: SET  
 – This is a set of sequential rules governing access to a specified asset.

• Rule Type: Permission with Conditional Obligations  
 – The policy permits access subject to a series of conditional steps.

• Actions:
 – External researchers accessing the Historical Manuscripts Archive.  
 – The Archives Committee “reviewing” the researcher’s publication history prior to granting access.  
 – The Digital Rights Department “verifying” the publication history.  
 – Researchers “submitting credentials” via the Archive Access Portal after preliminary access is granted.

• Actors:
 – Assignee: External Researchers (the party that will eventually receive access)  
 – Assigners/Administrators: Archives Committee, Digital Rights Department (the entities responsible for the approval process)  
 – Supporting System: Archive Access Portal (used for submitting credentials)

• Target Assets:
 – Historical Manuscripts Archive  
 – Archive Access Portal (as the mechanism for credential submission)

Issues Detected
──────────────────────────────
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
 • The policy does not define measurable criteria or thresholds for “reviewing” the researcher’s publication history.  
  – Explanation: Without specific benchmarks (e.g., minimum number of publications, quality standards, or explicit evaluation criteria), the review cannot be objectively verified. This lack of measurability violates implementation requirements.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
 • The verb “reviewing” (as in “reviewing the researcher’s publication history”) is used without detail.  
  – Explanation: The term “review” is ambiguous unless precise, measurable action criteria are defined. This vagueness prevents consistent enforcement and automated implementation, thereby triggering rejection.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
 • No overlapping or conflicting time windows are specified in the policy.
  – Explanation: No violations detected under temporal constraints.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
 • No location or geographical hierarchy rules are mentioned.
  – Explanation: No conflicts detected concerning location-based access.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
 • The process “preliminary access to submit their credentials” is not fully elaborated.
  – Recommendation: Clarify what constitutes “preliminary access” and outline any related conditions.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
 • Specific measurable criteria for the Archives Committee’s evaluation are missing.
  – Recommendation: Define clear, quantifiable standards (e.g., number of publications, peer-review status, etc.) for the review process.
 • The sequential timeline for actions is not provided.
  – Recommendation: Consider including time limits for each approval or verification step.

7. Conflict Issues:
 • The sequential process is clear with no circular dependencies as each step follows in order:
  (1) Preliminary access → (2) Credential submission → (3) Verification → (4) Review leading to final access.
  – Explanation: There is no cycle that forces one step to depend indefinitely on a previous step.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
 • No role or location hierarchy violations are present.
  – Explanation: All roles (External Researchers, Archives Committee, Digital Rights Department) are clearly delineated without conflicting authority.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
 • The vagueness in the “review” step creates subjectivity, potentially leading to inconsistent enforcement.  
  – Explanation: Without explicit, objective criteria, it may be impractical to implement or automate trustable access decisions.
 • The policy uses specific parties and detailed process steps except for the non-measurable “review” action.
  – Explanation: The lack of measurable criteria for that key step undermines real-world applicability.

Decision
──────────────────────────────
Status: REJECTED

Rationale: The policy is rejected because it relies on an undefined and non-measurable action verb (“reviewing” the researcher’s publication history). Without specific, objective criteria for this critical approval step, the enforcement and consistency of the policy cannot be ensured. This violates the core requirement for measurable and unambiguous rules in access control.

──────────────────────────────
Alternative Policy
──────────────────────────────
An alternative version addressing all identified issues could be written as follows:

"External researchers may access the Historical Manuscripts Archive only after receiving explicit approval from the Archives Committee. The Archives Committee shall grant access only if the researcher’s publication history meets the following objective criteria: a minimum of three peer-reviewed publications in a related field, or an equivalent demonstrated standard. Prior to review, the researcher must obtain preliminary access to the Archive Access Portal to submit their credentials. The Digital Rights Department shall verify the submitted publication details within 7 business days, confirming that the publications are valid and meet the stated criteria. Once verified, the Archives Committee will conduct a detailed evaluation based on these explicit, measurable standards and, if satisfied, grant final access within an additional 3 business days. Final access to the Historical Manuscripts Archive will be provided only after all procedures are successfully completed."

──────────────────────────────
Improvement Suggestions
──────────────────────────────
• Define precise, quantitative criteria for the Archives Committee’s review to eliminate subjectivity.  
 – For example, specify a minimum number of peer-reviewed publications or include publication quality metrics.

• Clarify “preliminary access” by outlining the conditions under which researchers may submit their credentials and by defining any related access limitations.

• Include explicit time frames for each sequential step (credential submission, verification, and review) to ensure a predictable and enforceable process.

• Consider adding a formal checklist or rubric for the review process to ensure consistency across cases.

Summary of Analysis and Reasoning
──────────────────────────────
1. The policy was identified as a SET with conditional permissions, but one of the key actions ("reviewing the researcher’s publication history") was determined to be vague due to the absence of measurable criteria.  
2. No critical issues were found regarding temporal constraints, location-based conflicts, circular dependencies, or hierarchical violations.  
3. The lack of explicit and objective criteria for a critical decision point (the review) renders the policy impractical for reliable implementation and enforcement.  
4. Based on these issues—and particularly the use of a vague action verb—the policy must be rejected.

This concludes the analysis and final decision.
