Original Policy Statement
──────────────────────────────────────────────
"The Cultural Heritage Digital Repository must process all image processing requests within 5 seconds while performing full 8K resolution conversion, lossless compression, and AI-based analysis on each file. The system must operate on standard consumer hardware without dedicated GPUs."

Policy Analysis Summary
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• Policy Type: SET  
  – This is a system requirement specification that assigns obligations to the Cultural Heritage Digital Repository.

• Rule Type: OBLIGATION  
  – The term “must” imposes explicit required behaviors on the system.

• Actions:  
  1. Process all image processing requests.  
  2. Perform full 8K resolution conversion on each file.  
  3. Execute lossless compression on each file.  
  4. Conduct AI-based analysis on each file.

• Actors:  
  – Assignee: The Cultural Heritage Digital Repository (i.e., the system required to perform these actions).  
  – Assigner: Implicitly the policy maker or system requirements authority (not explicitly mentioned in the statement).

• Target Assets:  
  – Image processing requests.  
  – Image files on which conversion, compression, and analysis are performed.

Issues Detected
──────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
  • Although the policy specifies “within 5 seconds,” it imposes three heavy processing tasks (8K conversion, lossless compression, AI-based analysis) that are not realistically measurable on standard consumer hardware without GPUs.
  • Why it’s non-measurable: The combined computational load under the specified hardware constraint makes it practically impossible to guarantee such a performance benchmark. This creates an inherent contradiction between performance time and hardware capabilities.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
  • There are no vague action verbs in the policy—the actions (conversion, compression, analysis) are specific in their expected outcomes.
  • No additional vague actions are detected.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
  • The policy imposes a strict 5-second processing window for all image processing requests.
  • There are no overlapping or conflicting temporal windows mentioned; however, the 5-second deadline conflicts with the computational intensity demanded.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
  • There is no mention of locations or geographical scopes that could cause conflicts.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
  • The policy does not clearly indicate what happens if a request exceeds the 5-second window (e.g., error handling, fallback procedures).
  • Recommendation: Clarify steps for requests that cannot meet the strict time requirement.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
  • The parties (assigner and assignee) are not fully defined beyond the system responsibility.
  • Recommendation: Specify who enforces or monitors the policy and under what conditions adjustments are permitted.

7. Conflict Issues:
  • The critical conflict is between the intensive processing required (8K resolution, lossless compression, AI-based analysis) and the severely constrained runtime (5 seconds) on standard consumer hardware without dedicated GPUs.
  • This conflict creates a clear implementation impossibility.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
  • No hierarchy violations are detected regarding roles or locations.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
  • CRITICAL CHECK: The policy demands universal and very high computational performance (“all image processing requests” must be processed under the heavy load).
  • This requirement is overly broad and practically unachievable with the stated hardware limitations.
  • The combination of high-resolution conversion, compression, and AI analysis within 5 seconds on standard consumer hardware not only violates practical computational limits but could also lead to unintended consequences such as system performance degradation or failure in real-world scenarios.

Decision
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Status: REJECTED

Rationale:  
The policy is rejected because the combined requirement to perform full 8K conversion, lossless compression, and AI-based analysis on every file within 5 seconds – when limited to standard consumer hardware without dedicated GPUs – creates an inherently contradictory and practically unfeasible mandate. Although the actions and time constraints are clearly specified, their simultaneous enforcement is impossible given current hardware capabilities. This irreconcilable conflict in performance requirements triggers a critical implementation rejection.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Alternative Policy
──────────────────────────────────────────────
"A revised policy should set realistic performance targets based on available hardware capabilities. For example:

'The Cultural Heritage Digital Repository must process image processing requests using a staged workflow. Under standard operating conditions on consumer-grade hardware, the system should perform full 4K resolution conversion, lossless compression, and AI-based analysis on each file. Each stage of processing is targeted to complete within 15 seconds, with the overall end-to-end process not exceeding 45 seconds. The system is designed to leverage optional hardware accelerators (e.g., dedicated GPUs) when available. In the absence of such accelerators, the processing may be queued to ensure overall system stability.'"

This alternative policy:
 • Reduces the processing resolution from 8K to 4K to match consumer hardware capabilities.
 • Extends processing time limits to sustainable windows.
 • Introduces optional hardware acceleration rather than strictly prohibiting dedicated GPUs.
 • Provides a staged workflow with queuing to manage processing loads and unforeseen delays.

Improvement Suggestions
──────────────────────────────────────────────
• Revise the resolution requirements to match the realistic capabilities of standard consumer hardware.  
• Extend the allowed processing time to ensure each intensive operation can be completed without overloading the system.  
• Consider allowing optional or hybrid hardware configurations (e.g., consumer systems with optional dedicated accelerators) for improved performance.  
• Include error handling or fallback procedures in the event that processing cannot be completed within the prescribed time.  
• Clearly delineate roles by specifying who monitors performance and enforces the policy requirements.  

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Your analysis and reasoning have led to the decision to reject the original policy due to its unrealistic performance requirements given the hardware limitations. The provided alternative policy and improvement suggestions offer a realistic pathway for achieving similar goals while respecting practical constraints.
