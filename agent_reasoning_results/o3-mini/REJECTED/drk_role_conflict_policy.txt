# Policy Analysis: drk_role_conflict_policy

## Original Policy
Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted to all researchers for academic purposes. All managers must have full access to this dataset at all times to monitor research activities. All administrators are strictly prohibited from accessing this dataset under any circumstances. According to the organizational structure, all managers are also classified as administrators in the system.

## Original Policy Statement
"Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted to all researchers for academic purposes. All managers must have full access to this dataset at all times to monitor research activities. All administrators are strictly prohibited from accessing this dataset under any circumstances. According to the organizational structure, all managers are also classified as administrators in the system."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Set
- Rule Type:
  - Permission: Granting access to researchers and managers.
  - Obligation/Duty: Managers must have full access at all times.
  - Prohibition: Administrators are strictly prohibited from accessing the dataset.
- Actions:
  - Granting access for academic purposes.
  - Requiring full access for monitoring research activities.
  - Strictly prohibiting access.
- Actors:
  - Assignees: Researchers (granted access), Managers (required access).
  - Assigner: Organizational policy (implied authority).
- Target Assets: Cultural Heritage Dataset

## Issues Detected
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - There are no non-measurable constraints present; the phrase "at all times" is clear and measurable.
   
2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No inherently vague action verbs are used. The actions (grant, require, prohibit) are clearly stated.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No conflicting time windows exist apart from the continuous ("at all times") access requirement, which by itself is measurable.
   
4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No location-based rules or hierarchical location constraints are specified.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy does not ambiguously define “researchers” beyond the academic purpose clause. However, no specific urgency issues are indicated in terms of triggering a rejection.
   
6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy does not clarify whether the prohibition for administrators applies universally or only to those who are not also performing managerial duties. Although roles are defined, the phrasing "all administrators" creates uncertainty due to the organizational overlap.
   
7. Conflict Issues:
   - Semantic Contradiction: The policy mandates that managers must have full access but simultaneously prohibits administrators. According to the organizational structure, all managers are also classified as administrators. This creates a direct logical conflict where the same individuals are both granted and denied access—a contradiction that makes implementation impossible.
   
8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - Role Hierarchy Conflict: According to the organizational structure, managers are a subset of administrators. The contradictory rules concerning these overlapping roles directly violate role hierarchy consistency.
   
9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - The contradiction inherent in requiring access for managers (who are administrators) while prohibiting administrators entirely leads to an impossible enforcement scenario. This creates an unacceptable implementation challenge in any real-world system.

## Decision
- Status: REJECTED
- Rationale: The policy contains an irreconcilable semantic contradiction. Managers are required to have full access, but since all managers are also administrators, the prohibition on administrators directly conflicts with the requirement for managers. This logical contradiction makes any implementation of the policy impossible.

## Alternative Policy
"Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted to all researchers for academic purposes. For effective monitoring of research activities, individuals designated as managers will have full access to the dataset at all times. Note that administrators who are not assigned a managerial role are prohibited from accessing this dataset. In cases where a person holds both managerial and administrative roles, they shall be treated exclusively as a manager with full access rights."

## Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly distinguish roles: Ensure that overlapping roles (e.g., managers and administrators) are unambiguously defined such that conflicting permissions or prohibitions are not assigned to the same individual.
- Explicit exceptions: Clearly state any exceptions for individuals who may fall into multiple roles. For instance, if managerial duties take precedence over administrative restrictions, ensure that the policy reflects this priority.
- Role reclassification: If the overlap between managers and administrators is intrinsic to the system, consider revising role definitions to avoid conflicts, such that the prohibited category (administrators) excludes those performing managerial functions.
- Provide context: Clarify the purposes and responsibilities of each role to prevent ambiguity in determining access rights.
