## Original Policy Statement
"The Cultural Heritage API grants access to the Medieval Collection for researchers located in Germany. At the same time, the system must strictly prohibit all access to the Medieval Collection for ALL researchers within the European Union."

------------------------------------------------------------
## Policy Analysis Summary

• Policy Type: Set  
 – This policy defines overall access rules for specific groups without an explicit assigner/assignee structure.

• Rule Type:  
 – Permission: Grants access to the Medieval Collection for researchers located in Germany.  
 – Prohibition: Strictly prohibits all access to the Medieval Collection for all researchers within the European Union.

• Actions:  
 – Granting access  
 – Prohibiting access

• Actors:  
 – Permission applies to "researchers located in Germany".  
 – Prohibition applies to "ALL researchers within the European Union".

• Target Assets:  
 – The Medieval Collection (accessed via the Cultural Heritage API)

## Issues Detected

1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - There are no non-measurable constraints such as vague temporal limits, quantitative assessments, or imprecise location criteria.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - All actions (granting and prohibiting access) are clearly stated with specific target groups; no vague verbs are present.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No temporal time windows or temporal constraints have been defined in the policy, hence no overlap or contradiction in timing exists.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - The policy defines two location-based rules:
     • Researchers located in Germany are granted access.
     • All researchers within the European Union are prohibited access.
   - Critical Conflict: Germany is a member of the European Union. Therefore, researchers in Germany fall under both rules simultaneously, leading to a direct contradiction—granting and denying access to the same group.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - There is some ambiguity regarding the intended overriding rule. It remains unclear which rule should take precedence when a researcher qualifies as both residing in Germany and being a part of the European Union.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy does not indicate any resolution strategy in the event of overlapping constraints (e.g., a conflict resolution mechanism between country-specific and regional rules).

7. Conflict Issues:
   - Logical Conflict: The overlapping geographic constraints make it impossible to implement a consistent, enforceable access policy for researchers in Germany due to simultaneous permission and prohibition.
   - No circular dependencies have been detected.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - There is a clear location hierarchy violation: Germany is part of the European Union, and the policy currently applies conflicting rules based on this hierarchy.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - Because the policy uses overlapping location constraints, it would be impossible to implement consistently in practice.
   - The contradiction between granting access to Germany and prohibiting access within the EU undermines the basic principles of consistent policy enforcement and introduces an immediate implementation challenge.
   - The resulting contradiction directly violates real-world security and access control requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Decision

• Status: REJECTED

• Rationale:  
The policy must be rejected because its overlapping location constraints create a direct semantic contradiction. Specifically, it simultaneously grants access to researchers located in Germany while prohibiting access for all researchers in the European Union—even though Germany is part of the European Union. This conflict makes it impossible to determine a clear, implementable outcome for researchers in Germany.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Alternative Policy

Alternative Policy Statement:  
"The Cultural Heritage API grants access to the Medieval Collection exclusively to researchers located in Germany. Researchers located outside Germany are strictly prohibited from accessing the Medieval Collection."

Explanation:  
By restricting access solely to researchers in Germany and denying access to all others (regardless of broader regional affiliations), this alternative eliminates the overlapping and conflicting location-based rules. Implementers will only need to assess whether a researcher’s location is in Germany to grant or deny access, ensuring clear and consistent enforcement.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Improvement Suggestions

1. If broader geographic conditions are desired in the future, explicitly define a hierarchy of rules or include conflict resolution strategies. For example, if a policy needs to cover multiple overlapping regions, specify which rule takes priority (e.g., national rules override regional prohibitions or vice versa).

2. Clearly define all geographic boundaries and their relationships. When a country is part of a larger region (such as Germany being a member of the EU), ensure that the access permissions are not contradictory—either by providing an exemption clause or by removing the conflicting rule entirely.

3. Consider adding temporal or activation conditions if the access rights are to change over time. Clear, measurable constraints would prevent similar ambiguities.

By addressing these issues, the policy will be clearer and more readily implementable in a real-world setting without conflicting rules.
