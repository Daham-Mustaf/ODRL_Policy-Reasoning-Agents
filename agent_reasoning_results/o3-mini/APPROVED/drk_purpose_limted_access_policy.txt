## Bellow is LLMs reasoning for this decision
---------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------
## Original Policy Statement
"The dataset 'OralTraditionsArchive' may be used only for educational purposes. Commercial use is strictly prohibited."

------------------------------------------------------------
## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Set Policy (defines clear usage rules without explicitly assigning specific roles)
- Rule Type: 
  • Permission: The dataset is permitted for educational purposes.
  • Prohibition: Commercial use of the dataset is strictly prohibited.
- Actions: 
  • "Use" of the dataset is allowed when for educational purposes.
  • "Use" of the dataset is not allowed for commercial purposes.
- Actors:
  • Assignee: Any individual or entity intending to use the dataset (implied users).
  • Assigner: Not explicitly defined, but implicitly the custodian or owner of the dataset.
- Target Assets: The dataset "OralTraditionsArchive"

------------------------------------------------------------
## Issues Detected
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None detected. The usage constraints (educational use only vs. commercial use prohibited) are explicitly defined without vague or non-measurable terms.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None detected. The action “use” is clearly constrained by the purpose (educational) and prohibition (commercial), and no vague verbs or criteria are present.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No temporal constraints or time windows are provided; therefore, no contradictions exist.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - Not applicable. The policy does not mention any specific locations or geographic constraints, so no conflicts exist.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - No significant ambiguities are present regarding the dataset or the type of allowed/prohibited use.
   - Note: While the policy does not explicitly define the users (actors), this vagueness does not trigger rejection and is acceptable in context.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy could potentially specify the responsible party (assigner) more clearly. However, the current description sufficiently distinguishes between permitted and prohibited uses.
   - This is a minor area for clarification and does not require rejection.

7. Conflict Issues:
   - No logical conflicts or circular dependencies are identified.
   - The permitted and prohibited actions are mutually exclusive and do not conflict.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - No hierarchy violations are noted; neither role nor location hierarchies create a conflict.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - The policy is clear, specific, and practical to implement. It delineates exactly what usage is allowed (educational) and what is not (commercial) without overbroad or vague terms.
   - No use of overly broad universal quantifiers that would prevent real-world enforcement.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Decision
- Status: APPROVED
- Rationale: The policy distinctly specifies the permitted use (educational purposes) and explicitly prohibits commercial use of the "OralTraditionsArchive" dataset. There are no non-measurable constraints, vague actions, or logical contradictions. The policy is clear, actionable, and applicable in a real-world setting.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Alternative Policy
Not applicable, as the policy has been approved.

------------------------------------------------------------
## Improvement Suggestions
- Although the policy is clear and enforceable as is, you may consider specifying the responsible party (assigner) explicitly for enhanced clarity (e.g., "The dataset provided by [Institution Name]"). This is optional, as the current policy sufficiently outlines the usage constraints.

------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, the policy meets the criteria required for creating an ODRL policy and can be implemented without modifications.
