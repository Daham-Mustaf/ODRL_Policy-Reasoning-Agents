## Original Policy Statement
"The Münzkabinett grants free access to selected cultural datasets Only if the purpose of using the data is non-commercial marketing to enhance the institution's visibility."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: OFFER  
- Rule Type: PERMISSION  
- Actions: Grants free access to selected cultural datasets  
- Actors:  
  - Assigner: The Münzkabinett  
  - Assignee: Any party meeting the condition (users intending to use the data for non-commercial marketing to enhance the institution's visibility)  
- Target Assets: Selected cultural datasets

## Issues Detected
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None identified. While the term “non-commercial marketing” could be open to interpretation, it does not introduce a non-measurable constraint that requires immediate rejection.
   
2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None identified. The action “grants free access” is specific and clearly observable.
   
3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No time windows or temporal conditions are stated; hence, no contradictions exist.
   
4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No location-based requirements or restrictions are present in this policy.
   
5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The phrase “non-commercial marketing to enhance the institution's visibility” might benefit from further clarification or examples to reduce potential ambiguity in its interpretation.
   
6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy does not specify which datasets are considered “selected cultural datasets” or detail any criteria for selection. While not critical, additional specificity could improve clarity.
   
7. Conflict Issues:
   - No logical conflicts or circular dependencies are detected.
   
8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - No hierarchy violations are evident.
   
9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - The policy is practically implementable. It does not employ universal quantifiers without appropriate restrictions, and the conditional constraint is clearly attached to the purpose of data use.

## Decision
- Status: APPROVED  
- Rationale: The policy is clear, specific, and implementable. It grants permission under a well-defined condition without introducing any critical non-measurable constraints, vague actions, or logical contradictions.

## Alternative Policy
Not applicable since the policy has been approved.

## Improvement Suggestions
- Consider providing additional details or examples to clarify what constitutes “non-commercial marketing” in this context.  
- Specify the criteria or list the key aspects of the “selected cultural datasets” to enhance clarity on which data are covered by the policy.
