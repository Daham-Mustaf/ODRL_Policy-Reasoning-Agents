## Original Policy Statement
"The Daten Raumkultur connector allows UC4 partners to view a maximum of 50 images per day. This restriction is in place to maintain limited access to the dataset."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: SET policy  
  (This rule establishes a constraint for a defined group rather than forming an offer, request, or bilateral agreement.)

- Rule Type: Permission with a quantitative prohibition component  
  (It permits the action of viewing images, but restricts it by enforcing a maximum limit.)

- Actions: 
  - View images

- Actors: 
  - Assignee: UC4 partners (the group permitted to view images)  
  - Assigner: (implicitly, the policy issuer or system that manages access, though not explicitly defined)

- Target Assets: 
  - Images (explicitly mentioned)  
  - Dataset (implicitly referenced as the broader collection from which the images come)

## Issues Detected

1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None detected. The quantitative limit of "50 images per day" is clearly measurable.

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No vague action verbs are present. The action "view" is specific and observable.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No temporal contradictions are detected. The policy clearly stipulates a "per day" time window with no overlapping or conflicting intervals.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None. There are no location-based rules or requirements mentioned.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy mentions both "images" and the "dataset" without clearly defining whether the limit applies solely to individual images, the overall dataset access, or both.
   - Recommendation: Clarify if the 50-image limit applies to each individual image viewed, or if it is intended to govern overall dataset access to specific images.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The definition of "UC4 partners" could be more specific to avoid ambiguity regarding their roles and responsibilities.
   - Recommendation: Consider including a clear definition or reference for who qualifies as a "UC4 partner."

7. Conflict Issues:
   - No logical conflicts or circular dependencies are present.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - None detected. There is no mention of conflicting requirements in a hierarchical manner (neither location nor role hierarchy issues).

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - The policy is clear and has a measurable quantitative constraint, making it implementable.
   - The minor issue concerning the dual reference to "images" and the "dataset" should be addressed to avoid potential misunderstandings during enforcement.

## Decision
- Status: APPROVED (with a recommendation for minor revision)
- Rationale:  
  The policy is specific regarding the action, actor, quantitative limit, and temporal constraint. There are no critical issues such as non-measurable constraints, vague actions, or logical contradictions. However, clarity regarding the target assets (distinguishing between individual images and the overall dataset) and a more precise definition of "UC4 partners" is advisable.

## Alternative Policy
(No complete rewrite is necessary since the policy is APPROVED. However, an improved version is suggested under the Improvement Suggestions section.)

## Improvement Suggestions
- Clarify the Target Assets:  
  Specify whether the 50-image limit applies solely to individual images or whether it is intended to limit access within the entire dataset. For example:  
  "The Daten Raumkultur connector allows UC4 partners to view a maximum of 50 individual images per day from the dataset."

- Define UC4 Partners:  
  If applicable, include a brief definition or reference to which entities or roles qualify as UC4 partners to avoid ambiguity in practical enforcement.  
  For example:  
  "UC4 partners, defined as authorized member organizations participating in the UC4 program, are permitted to view..."

By addressing these points, the policy will be clearer for implementers while maintaining its current intent and enforceability.
