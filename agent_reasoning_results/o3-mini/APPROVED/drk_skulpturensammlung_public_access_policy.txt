## Original Policy Statement
"The Skulpturensammlung museum wants to provide public access to digital reproductions of the artwork 'Große Düne' by C. D. Friedrich. Museum Münzkabinett and are permitted to view and download digital images for sharing and non-commercial use."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Agreement  
  (An assigner, The Skulpturensammlung museum, provides permission to an assignee, Museum Münzkabinett, regarding specific actions.)
- Rule Type: Permission  
  (The policy explicitly permits the assignee to perform the actions.)
- Actions:  
  • View the digital images  
  • Download the digital images
- Actors:  
  • Assigner: The Skulpturensammlung museum  
  • Assignee: Museum Münzkabinett (with a note on "public access" that suggests broader availability for non-commercial sharing)
- Target Assets:  
  • Digital reproductions and digital images of the artwork “Große Düne” by C. D. Friedrich

## Issues Detected
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None detected. All constraints are specific (i.e., usage is limited to sharing and non-commercial use).

2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - None detected. The actions “view” and “download” are concrete and clearly defined.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No temporal constraints are present; hence, no overlapping or contradictory time windows exist.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
   - No location requirements or conflicts are present.

5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - There is a minor ambiguity regarding the phrase “public access.” While the statement begins by mentioning public access to the digital reproductions, it later specifically names Museum Münzkabinett as the entity permitted to view and download the images. Clarifying whether access is limited exclusively to Museum Münzkabinett or more broadly available for public viewing could improve clarity.

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - The policy could more explicitly define whether Museum Münzkabinett's permission is the sole channel for public access or if the digital images are accessible to the general public under non-commercial conditions. This slight vagueness is non-critical but worth addressing.

7. Conflict Issues:
   - No logical conflicts or circular dependencies detected.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - No additional hierarchy violations detected.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - The policy is practically implementable. It clearly permits measurable actions under a defined non-commercial sharing condition. The scope is not overly broad as it restricts usage to sharing and non-commercial purposes.

## Decision
- Status: APPROVED  
- Rationale: The policy is clear, specific, and implementable. It effectively defines the permitted actions (view and download), the involved parties, and the target assets. The only minor improvement is to clarify the relationship between “public access” and the specific permission granted to Museum Münzkabinett, but this does not impede practical implementation.

## Alternative Policy
(Not applicable since the policy is approved.)

## Improvement Suggestions
- Clarify the scope of “public access.” For example, specify whether digital reproductions are available exclusively through Museum Münzkabinett or if they are accessible to any user, provided that the use is sharing and non-commercial.  
- Optionally, reframe the statement as:  
  "The Skulpturensammlung museum wants to provide public access to digital reproductions of the artwork 'Große Düne' by C. D. Friedrich. To facilitate this, Museum Münzkabinett is permitted to view and download the digital images for purposes of sharing and non-commercial use."  

This minor clarification will eliminate any potential ambiguity regarding who may access the digital reproductions.
