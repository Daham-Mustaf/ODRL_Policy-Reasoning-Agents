## Original Policy Statement
"Everyone can access all music files in the archive."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** Permission
- **Actions:** Access
- **Actors:** Assignee - Everyone; Assigner - Not specified
- **Target Assets:** All music files in the archive

## Issues Detected
1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - The term "Everyone" is a non-measurable constraint as it does not define specific individuals or roles who have access. This lack of definition violates requirements for accountability and scope in policy.
  
2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - While the action "access" is specific, it is vague in the context as it does not define how or what method will be used for accessing the music files.

3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - There are no temporal constraints mentioned, thus there are no contradictions identified.

4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - There are no location constraints provided; therefore, no conflicting location requirements exist.

5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The term "all music files" lacks specificity. There need to be clarifications around which music files are included. 
   - Recommendation: Specify the music files by genre, format, or other defining characteristics.

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - Missing definitions of specific roles (who is included in "Everyone") and specific music files in the archive.
   - Recommendation: Address the vagueness of actors and assets.

7. **Conflict Issues:**
   - There are no logical conflicts or contradictions detected in the policy.

8. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - There are no relevant hierarchy violations noted in the analysis.

9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - The policy's use of "Everyone" creates enforcement challenges and could lead to significant security risks by allowing unauthorized access.
   - The broad and universal language without clear restrictions makes it impractical for real-world application, as it may infringe on privacy and regulatory requirements.

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED
- **Rationale:** The policy is too broad and vague due to its use of universal quantifiers like "Everyone," rendering it impractical for real-world application. The lack of specificity regarding the assets and actors makes it fundamentally incompatible with security requirements.

## Alternative Policy
"Access to specific music files in the archive is granted to registered users only, subject to individual permissions based on their roles. Each user will have access to a designated set of music files as determined by the archive management team."

## Improvement Suggestions
- Specify the types of music files included in the archive.
- Define the actors more precisely to indicate which users or roles are permitted access.
- Implement conditions or criteria under which access is granted.
