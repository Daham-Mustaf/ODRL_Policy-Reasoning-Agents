# Policy Analysis: drk_technical_impossibility_policy

## Original Policy
All digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository must be simultaneously encrypted with AES-256 for security and stored as plaintext to enable full-text indexing. The system must maintain a single copy of each file that satisfies both requirements without any transformation during retrieval.

## Expected Decision
REJECTED

## LLM's Decision
UNKNOWN

## Manual Review

## Original Policy Statement
"All digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository must be simultaneously encrypted with AES-256 for security and stored as plaintext to enable full-text indexing. The system must maintain a single copy of each file that satisfies both requirements without any transformation during retrieval."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** Obligation
- **Actions:** 
  - Encrypt digital artifacts with AES-256
  - Store encrypted files as plaintext (which is contradictory)
- **Actors:** 
  - Assigner: Not explicitly stated
  - Assignee: Not explicitly stated, but it implies repository administrators or related staff
- **Target Assets:** Digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository

## Chain of Thought Reasoning
The initial analysis examined the policy but revealed several key contradictions during the reasoning process. 

Key improvements from the chain of thought process:
1. Identification of the key contradiction between requirements: being encrypted and stored as plaintext cannot occur simultaneously.
2. Clarification that vague definitions for actors (assigners & assignees) need more specificity for effective enforcement.
3. Highlighted the necessity for clear definitions regarding "digital artifacts" to avoid misinterpretation.

Differences in final analysis:
- The analytical process re-evaluated the implications of simultaneous encryption and plaintext storage, resulting in the conclusion to reject the policy for logical inconsistencies.
- There was a deeper examination of potential ambiguities and contradictions that might compromise the document's effectiveness.

Aspects requiring critical re-examination included:
- The contradictory request for files to be both encrypted and stored as plaintext.
- The need for more explicit actor definitions to ensure accountability.

## Issues Detected
1. **Ambiguity Issues:**
   - The term "digital artifacts" is vague. 
     - **Recommendation**: Specify what constitutes digital artifacts (e.g., images, documents, audio files).
   
2. **Measurability Issues:**
   - The requirement for simultaneous encryption and plaintext storage is unmeasurable and contradictory. 
     - **Improvements**: Update the requirement to either use encryption for security or a method that allows indexing without plaintext exposure.
   
3. **Completeness Issues:**
   - Missing elements: Clear definitions of responsibility for encryption and storage could be included.
     
4. **Conflict Issues:**
   - Direct contradiction exists between "encrypted" and "stored as plaintext". 
     - These requirements cannot coexist logically within the same policy.
     
5. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - Not explicitly identified; no hierarchy violations found in the policy structure.
   
6. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - The requirements conflict makes the policy impossible to implement practically. 
   - Requiring a file to be simultaneously in two incompatible states (encrypted and plaintext) is unreasonable.

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED
- **Rationale:** The policy includes critical contradictions that make it unimplementable, as it requires digital artifacts to be both encrypted and stored as plaintext simultaneously.

## Alternative Policy
**Revised Policy Statement:**
"All digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository must be encrypted with AES-256 to ensure their security. The repository shall implement a secure mechanism for full-text indexing that allows for retrieval of encrypted files while maintaining their confidentiality. Adequate decryption protocols will be employed during retrieval without exposing any digital artifacts in plaintext form."

### Rationale:
- This revised policy addresses identified contradictions and provides a feasible approach to secure storage and retrieval of digital artifacts, aligning security needs while allowing for indexing.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. Clearly define "digital artifacts" to specify types of files included.
2. Elaborate on roles and responsibilities regarding the enforcement of the encryption and retrieval mechanisms to clarify accountability.
3. Consider specifying how the full-text indexing will be handled securely without compromising the encryption standards. 

With these corrections, both the analysis and the policy itself are now clearer and implementable in a real-world setting.
