## Original Policy Statement
"Researchers require Archives Committee approval to access manuscripts. Approvals require Digital Rights verification of publication history. Verification requires credential submission through the Access Portal. Portal access requires Archives Committee pre-approval."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type**: Set
- **Rule Type**: Obligation and Permission
- **Actions**: 
  - Require Archives Committee approval
  - Verify Digital Rights
  - Submit credentials
  - Gain access to manuscripts
- **Actors**:
  - Assigner: Archives Committee
  - Assignee: Researchers
- **Target Assets**: 
  - Manuscripts
  - Credentials

## Chain of Thought Reasoning
The initial analysis was refined through chain of thought reasoning.

**Key improvements from the chain of thought process:**
1. **Identification of Mixed Rule Type**: Initially, the rule type was not clearly defined, but through analysis, it was recognized as a combination of obligation (for approval) and permission (for access).
2. **Clarification of Process Steps**: The process for accessing manuscripts was better articulated, clarifying the sequence of actions required to avoid circular dependencies.
3. **Highlighting Circular Dependency Issue**: A critical flaw was identified regarding the requirement for pre-approval from the Archives Committee before researchers could gain necessary access.

**Differences from Initial Assessment**: The refined analysis provides a clearer understanding of the mixed rule type and the sequencing of actions, addressing the previously missed circular dependency that posed significant implementation challenges.

**Critical Re-examination**: The circular dependency involving the required approvals from the Archives Committee warranted the most critical re-examination, as it presented a barrier to practical implementation.

## Issues Detected
1. **Ambiguity Issues**:
   - The policy does not specify what "credentials" encompass. **Recommendation**: Define what constitutes valid credentials.
   
2. **Measurability Issues**:
   - The timeline for approvals is vague. **Improvements**: Establish a time frame for each step in the approval process.

3. **Completeness Issues**:
   - Missing explicit definitions for terms like "Digital Rights" and "Access Portal". **Additions**: Include detailed descriptions of these terms.

4. **Conflict Issues**:
   - A circular dependency between needing access to submit credentials for verification conflicts with the existing approval requirement. 

5. **Hierarchy Violations**:
   - The approval hierarchy lacks clarity, leading to confusion about who must approve which process first (The committee must approve before access grants can be verified, but verification is needed before approval is given).

6. **Real-world Implementation Issues**:
   - The proposed process is impractical due to circular dependencies, which could create bottlenecks. It may hinder researchers from accessing necessary manuscripts in a timely manner.

## Decision
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Rationale**: The presence of circular dependencies creates an impossible situation for implementation; therefore, the policy is deemed unsuitable for application.

## Alternative Policy
**Policy Statement: Access Protocol for Manuscripts**

1. Researchers must receive approval from the Archives Committee to access manuscripts.
2. To gain this approval, researchers need to submit their credentials through the Access Portal.
3. The Access Portal will be accessible only after the Archives Committee approves the submission of credentials.
4. Verification of Digital Rights pertaining to publication history must occur after the approval of credentials but before granting manuscript access.

**Approval Process**:
- Step 1: Researchers submit credentials to the Archives Committee.
- Step 2: Archives Committee assesses the submitted credentials.
- Step 3: Once approved, researchers receive Access Portal access instructions.
- Step 4: Researchers validate Digital Rights prior to the approval for manuscript access.

This structured approach removes circular dependencies and clarifies the sequence necessary for researchers to gain access to manuscripts, ensuring a functional implementation.

## Improvement Suggestions
- Define terms such as "credentials", "Digital Rights", and "Access Portal" for clarity.
- Establish a clear timeframe for each approval step to enhance communication and expectations.
- Explicitly outline the responsibilities and roles of both researchers and the Archives Committee for better accountability.
