# Policy Analysis: drk_role_conflict_policy

## Original Policy
Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted to all researchers for academic purposes. All managers must have full access to this dataset at all times to monitor research activities. All administrators are strictly prohibited from accessing this dataset under any circumstances. According to the organizational structure, all managers are also classified as administrators in the system.

## Original Policy Statement
"Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted to all researchers for academic purposes. All managers must have full access to this dataset at all times to monitor research activities. All administrators are strictly prohibited from accessing this dataset under any circumstances. According to the organizational structure, all managers are also classified as administrators in the system."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** Permission and Prohibition
- **Actions:**
  - Grant access to researchers for academic purposes.
  - Managers must have access at all times.
  - Administrators are prohibited from accessing the dataset.
- **Actors:**
  - **Assignee:** Researchers, Managers
  - **Assigner:** Organization (implicitly)
- **Target Assets:** Cultural Heritage Dataset

## Issues Detected

1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - There are no explicit numerical or temporal constraints present; however, the definitions of access ("full access", "all researchers") are vague and non-measurable, leading to ambiguity in enforcement.

2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - The actions of granting or prohibiting access are vague as they don't specify the nature and scope of "full access" or “access,” thus making it impossible to understand what is allowed.

3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - There are no explicit temporal conditions that overlap, however the existing conditions create contradictions in access based on roles.

4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No location hierarchy issues detected.

5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The term "full access" is ambiguous. Clarity on what constitutes full access is necessary.
   - The roles of "manager" and "administrator" could use clarification regarding their powers.

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The policy lacks definitions for "researchers," "managers," and "administrators."

7. **Conflict Issues:**
   - There is a direct conflict in the role definitions where managers are prohibited from accessing the dataset yet are required to do so for monitoring purposes.
   - **Critical - Circular Dependency Check:** There are no circular dependencies identified.

8. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - There is a violation in the hierarchy as Managers, classified as Administrators, cannot access while also being required to have access, which contradicts the expected behavior based on their roles.

9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - The policy is not practically enforceable because of the conflicting requirements placed on roles.
   - The universal quantification of "all researchers" without any defined scope is problematic.
   - It would foster confusion and potential non-compliance due to the unclear definitions and contradictions.

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED
- **Rationale:** The policy contains critical contradictions where managers must have access to a dataset yet are classified as administrators who cannot access it. This creates an impossible enforcement scenario, combined with vague terms and lack of clear definitions, leading to its rejection.

## Alternative Policy
"Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted explicitly to researchers employed by the organization for academic research during business hours (9 AM to 5 PM). Managers are granted full access to this dataset for the purpose of overseeing research activities, not classified as administrators for this specific task. Access requests by managers will be logged for audit purposes to ensure compliance. Administrators are restricted from accessing this dataset at all times unless given explicit permission for auditing by senior management. Definitions: 'Researchers' refer specifically to individuals involved in active research projects; 'Managers' are individuals overseeing those projects; 'Administrators' are individuals responsible for system operations but not involved directly in research."

## Improvement Suggestions
- Clarify the definitions of "researchers," "managers," and "administrators."
- Reassess the access permissions based on role definitions to eliminate conflicting constraints.
- Specify the scope and nature of "full access" to provide clarity on what actions can be taken with the dataset.
- Introduce a logging mechanism for manager access to promote accountability while ensuring that administrative roles do not have access.
