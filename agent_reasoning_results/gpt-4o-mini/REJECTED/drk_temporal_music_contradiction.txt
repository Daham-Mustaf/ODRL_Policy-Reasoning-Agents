## Original Policy Statement
"The track is available only after 2025, but it can also be used in 2024 for educational purposes."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type**: Agreement
- **Rule Type**: Permission
- **Actions**: Available, used for educational purposes
- **Actors**: Educational institutions (assigner); users (students, teachers - assignees must be specified)
- **Target Assets**: The track

## Chain of Thought Reasoning
The initial analysis was refined through chain of thought reasoning.

Key improvements from the chain of thought process:
1. **Identification of Policy Type**: It was determined that the policy is better classified as an Agreement rather than just a Set, as it specifies conditions for usage.
2. **Action Definition**: The actions were rephrased from vague terms like "available" and "used" to more specific actions such as "utilizing the track for educational purposes."
3. **Clarification of Actors and Assets**: The reassessment highlighted the need to specify actors (like students and educational institutions) and detailed the target asset.

Overall, the final analysis differs from the initial assessment as it provides clearer classifications and specifications, particularly regarding actors and actions. The most critical re-examination focused on clarifying the ambiguity around the actors and the actions related to the educational use of the track.

## Issues Detected
1. **Ambiguity Issues**:
   - The term "educational purposes" is vague. 
     - **Recommendation**: Define what constitutes educational use more clearly.
  
2. **Measurability Issues**:
   - Terms such as "available" and "used" lack clarity on metrics for measurement.
     - **Improvements**: Provide specific criteria for educational activities.

3. **Completeness Issues**:
   - Missing definitions regarding the education type and categories are absent.
     - **Suggested Additions**: Guidelines for approved educational activities.

4. **Conflict Issues**:
   - Overlapping time frames create confusion about when the track is available.
     - **Solution**: Clarify timelines and establish distinct periods for usage.

5. **Hierarchy Violations**:
   - Not identified but should be reviewed for any potential contradictions between individuals and institutional roles.

6. **Real-world Implementation Issues**:
   - The ambiguous criteria for educational use may hinder enforcement.
     - **Explanation**: A vague definition could complicate who qualifies for use.

## Decision
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Rationale**: The policy contains critical ambiguities, particularly regarding the timing of access and the definition of "educational purposes," making it unreasonable to implement effectively.

## Alternative Policy
"The track will be officially opened for general use on January 1, 2026. Prior to this date, the track can be utilized exclusively by accredited educational institutions for activities related to approved educational programs, such as training sessions, provided that permission is granted by the administration of the educational institution. Specific guidelines detailing what constitutes an approved educational activity will be included in a supplementary document, reviewed annually. Access hours for educational use will be set as weekdays from 9 AM to 5 PM."

This rewritten alternative addresses identified issues by clearly defining timelines, specific intended use, and distinctly outlining actionable criteria for educational activities.
