# Policy Analysis: drk_location_conflict_policy

## Original Policy
Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted exclusively within Germany, for approved researchers. However, access is prohibited in all locations outside of Germany, including all European countries. This creates a conflict as the dataset is accessible in Germany but completely restricted across Europe, which contradicts the expected availability within the European Union.

## Expected Decision

## Original Policy Statement
"Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted exclusively within Germany, for approved researchers. However, access is prohibited in all locations outside of Germany, including all European countries."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** Permission & Prohibition
- **Actions:** Grant access, prohibit access
- **Actors:** Assigner - Government/Institution granting access; Assignee - Approved researchers
- **Target Assets:** Cultural Heritage Dataset

## Chain of Thought Reasoning
The initial analysis was refined through chain of thought reasoning.

Key improvements from the chain of thought process:
1. **Actor Definitions:** The vague term "approved researchers" was highlighted for needing more clarity on who qualifies as an approved researcher, enhancing specificity.
2. **Geographical Conflicts:** The contradiction regarding access rights in Germany versus prohibitions outside was further emphasized, showing the necessity for a clear geographic policy.
3. **Regulatory Framework:** Recommendations were made to create a clear framework surrounding the approval process for researchers, ensuring better implementation feasibility.

The final analysis differs from the initial assessment by providing a more nuanced understanding of actor roles and identifying critical geographic contradictions more thoroughly. The aspect that required the most critical re-examination was the conflicting access rights across various jurisdictions within the European Union.

## Issues Detected
1. **Ambiguity Issues:**
   - The term "approved researchers" lacks a clear definition. **Recommendation:** Define specific criteria for approval to eliminate ambiguity.

2. **Measurability Issues:**
   - Constraints on access based on geography are present but not clearly measurable. **Improvement:** Define the process to measure compliance for geographic access.

3. **Completeness Issues:**
   - Missing definitions and guidelines about what constitutes "approved researchers." 

4. **Conflict Issues:**
   - Contradiction exists in allowing access in Germany while prohibiting it in surrounding European countries.

5. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - The policy violates geographical hierarchies as it permits access in Germany ("Germany is part of the EU") but prohibits it in neighboring EU countries.

6. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - Enforcing these geographic restrictions is impractical, creating barriers to reasonable implementation of the policy.

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED
- **Rationale:** The policy is not clear, contains critical issues such as geographic contradictions, and ambiguities in actor definitions make it unreasonable to implement.

## Alternative Policy
"Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is limited to individuals who are identified as approved researchers based in Germany. Approved researchers must meet specific criteria, which will be clearly defined in supplementary guidelines provided by the data office. Requests for access from individuals located outside of Germany, including those in other EU countries, will be explicitly denied to ensure compliance with jurisdictional data use regulations."

This alternative policy addresses the identified issues, providing clarity on the criteria for approval and eliminating geographical contradictions.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Define "Approved Researchers":** Establish clear criteria and a validation process for who qualifies, to remove ambiguity.
2. **Provide Geographical Clarity:** Specify the rationale behind the geographic restrictions and how researchers based in Germany can access the dataset, thus resolving conflicts with neighboring EU access rights.
3. **Measurable Compliance Guidelines:** Implement measurable standards for ensuring compliance with the policy.
