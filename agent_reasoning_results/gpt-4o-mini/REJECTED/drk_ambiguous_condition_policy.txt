## Original Policy
If researchers submit access requests for restricted manuscripts, then curators will review the request. If the request is approved, users can download high-resolution images. If the request is urgent, it will be expedited.

## Original Policy Statement
"If researchers submit access requests for restricted manuscripts, then curators will review the request. If the request is approved, users can download high-resolution images. If the request is urgent, it will be expedited."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type**: Set
- **Rule Type**: Combination of Permission, Obligation
- **Actions**: 
  - Submit access requests 
  - Review requests 
  - Approve requests 
  - Download high-resolution images 
  - Expedite requests 
- **Actors**: 
  - Assignee: Curators
  - Assigner: Researchers
- **Target Assets**: 
  - Restricted manuscripts 
  - High-resolution images 

## Chain of Thought Reasoning
The initial analysis was carefully reviewed and refined to enhance clarity, specificity, and completeness.

### Key improvements from the chain of thought process:
1. **Clarification of Actors**: Initial analysis noted vague roles (researchers, curators, users), which needed further specification. The roles were outlined and clarified to illustrate the dynamics more accurately.
2. **Definition of Urgency**: The ambiguity of the term "urgent" was critically examined, revealing a need for specific criteria to measure urgency effectively.
3. **Inclusion of Denial Procedures**: The initial analysis failed to address what happens to denied requests. Including a procedure for handling them resulted in a more thorough policy.

### Final Analysis vs. Initial Assessment:
The final analysis incorporated details such as response timelines and consequences for different request outcomes, which were not clearly defined in the original assessment. The aspects of urgency and what constitutes a denied request were thoroughly re-examined to provide greater clarity.

## Issues Detected
1. **Ambiguity Issues**:
   - "Urgent" is not defined. **Recommendation**: Specify what constitutes an urgent request (e.g., a deadline or project relevance).
   
2. **Measurability Issues**:
   - The lack of clear timeframes for responses and action per request. **Recommendation**: Establish clear timelines, such as a 48-hour response time for requests.
   
3. **Completeness Issues**:
   - Absence of procedures for denied requests. **Recommendation**: Include a statement indicating that denied requests will receive written explanations stating the reasons for denial.
   
4. **Conflict Issues**:
   - None detected.
   
5. **Hierarchy Violations**:
   - None identified.
   
6. **Real-world Implementation Issues**:
   - The vague nature of "urgent" creates practical barriers to enforcement. **Recommendation**: Define urgency more explicitly to improve implementability.

## Decision
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Rationale**: The policy has critical issues such as vague temporal constraints and unclear procedures for denied requests, which hinder its clarity and enforceability.

## Alternative Policy
"Researchers may submit access requests for restricted manuscripts. Curators are required to review each request within 48 hours. Approved requests will allow users to download high-resolution images. Requests that are marked as urgent must specify criteria (for example, project deadlines) and will be expedited accordingly. Any denied requests will receive written explanations citing specific reasons for denial."

## Improvement Suggestions
1. Define what constitutes an urgent request with specific criteria.
2. Establish a formal response timeframe for all requests.
3. Include procedures for handling denied requests to ensure clarity in the process.
