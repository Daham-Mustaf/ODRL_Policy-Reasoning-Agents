## Original Policy Statement
"Nobody can do anything."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** Prohibition
- **Actions:** No specific actions identified
- **Actors:** No identifiable assigners or assignees
- **Target Assets:** No specific resources or data are affected

## Chain of Thought Reasoning
The initial analysis was refined through a detailed review of the ambiguous language used in the policy statement.

Key improvements from the chain of thought process:
1. **Clarification of Roles:** The reasoning highlighted the absence of assigned actors or roles in the policy, indicating that specific definers could enhance clarity.
2. **Simplification of Vague Language:** It identified the need to replace vague terms like "anything" and "nobody" with specific actions and identified groups or roles.
3. **Identification of an Actionable Framework:** The process revealed the necessity for creating measurable and enforceable constraints to facilitate real-world application.

The final analysis differs from the initial assessment primarily through the specific identification of the policy’s ambiguities and the implication that it lacks defined actions, roles, and assets. The need for clarity in defining what “nothing” entails was the most critical aspect requiring re-examination.

## Issues Detected
1. **Ambiguity Issues:**
   - The term "nobody" is overly vague and does not clarify who is involved. **Recommendation:** Specify which parties or roles are subject to the prohibition.
   - The phrase "do anything" lacks precision. **Recommendation:** Define the actions that are prohibited to reduce ambiguity.

2. **Measurability Issues:**
   - Lack of measurable criteria for actions. **Recommendation:** Introduce specific actions or types of decisions that are affected by the prohibition.

3. **Completeness Issues:**
   - The analysis fails to include any target assets or groups affected by the prohibition. **Addition Needed:** Clearly state what specific activities are restricted.

4. **Conflict Issues:**
   - There's a logical conflict in stating a blanket prohibition without exceptions. This may lead to ambiguity regarding permissible actions. **Recommendation:** Define exceptions or a framework for clarity.

5. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - No specific locations or jurisdictions are defined, causing a lack of nexus for enforcement. **Clarification Needed:** Identify any organizational hierarchy tied to the roles.

6. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - This policy is impractical and unreasonable to enforce due to its vagueness and generalized prohibition. **Explanation:** Policies should be actionable and clear to ensure compliance and understanding.

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED
- **Rationale:** The policy contains vague terms, lacks clear actors, actions, or target assets, and is unmeasurable and impractical for real-world implementation.

## Alternative Policy
**Revised Policy Statement:**
"All designated personnel are prohibited from performing any activities outside those expressly authorized by management at all operational locations."

### Key Components of the Revised Policy:
1. **Policy Type:** Clearly defines “designated personnel” for better applicability.
2. **Rule Type:** Prohibition of unauthorized activities is specified.
3. **Specific Actions:** Activities are defined as "those expressly authorized," clarifying the prohibited scope.
4. **Actor Identification:** "Designated personnel" specifies the actors involved.
5. **Asset Identification:** "Activities" establishes the context for the prohibition.
6. **Constraints:** Clear boundaries of accountability and enforceability.
7. **Real-world Applicability:** Easily understandable and actionable within organizational contexts, facilitating enforcement.

This rewritten policy addresses all identified issues and provides clarity, making it feasible to implement effectively.  

## Improvement Suggestions
If the policy is marked NEEDS REVISION, consider the following suggestions to enhance clarity:
- Specify the responsible parties directly within the policy.
- Define the actions that are restricted in greater detail.
- State clear exceptions if any are to be allowed.
- Provide measurement or criteria for enforcement to guide designated personnel.
