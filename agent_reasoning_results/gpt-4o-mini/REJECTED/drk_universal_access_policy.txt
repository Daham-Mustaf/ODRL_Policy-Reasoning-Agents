## Original Policy Statement
"Everyone can access everything."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** Permission
- **Actions:** Access
- **Actors:** Assignee - Everyone; Assigner - Not specified
- **Target Assets:** Everything (vague, unspecified resources or data)

## Issues Detected
1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - "Everyone" is a non-measurable constraint as it lacks specificity. It implies universal access without defining the scope, resulting in potential violations of security principles.

2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - The action "access" is vague as it does not provide clear, specific, or measurable criteria for what access entails or under what conditions it can occur.

3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No defined temporal constraints present; however, the absence of defined constraints leads to potential conflict in timing for access.

4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No location specifications present, creating a lack of hierarchy analysis; however, the universal nature of "everyone" could conflict geographically.

5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The phrase "everything" is extremely ambiguous and should be clearly defined to specify what resources or data are included.

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - Missing specific asset identification and clarity around what "access" entails.
  
7. **Conflict Issues:**
   - The policy creates potential conflicts with basic security principles due to its vagueness and universal quantifiers.
  
8. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - Lack of defined relationships between actors and assets; therefore, no explicit hierarchy conflicts identified.
  
9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - The policy uses universal quantifiers without restrictions, making it impractical for real-world implementation. It violates basic security and privacy constraints, leading to immediate rejection.

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED
- **Rationale:** The policy is rejected due to the presence of vague action verbs, non-measurable constraints, and practical implementation issues that conflict with fundamental security requirements.

## Alternative Policy
"Access to specified resources and data shall be granted to defined user groups based on their roles and the permissions assigned to them. Each user group will have a clear description of what they can access, under which conditions access is allowed, and any necessary limitations based on privacy requirements and regulatory constraints."

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Define actors more clearly:** Specify who 'everyone' is and under which circumstances they are allowed access.
2. **Clarify actions:** Replace "can access" with specific actions that describe the expected behavior or operations permitted.
3. **Identify target assets:** Provide a clear list of what resources and data users are permitted to access.
4. **Set temporal conditions:** If applicable, include time frames for access permissions to avoid ambiguity.
