## Bellow is LLMs reasoning for this decision
---------------------------------------
## Original Policy Statement
"The Daten Raumkultur connector allows UC4 partners to view a maximum of 50 images per day. This restriction is in place to maintain limited access to the dataset."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** Prohibition
- **Actions:** view
- **Actors:** Assignee: UC4 partners; Assigner: Not explicitly defined
- **Target Assets:** Dataset (images), though not specifically identified

## Issues Detected
1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - None identified. The quantitative constraint of "maximum of 50 images per day" is measurable.

2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - None identified. The action "view" is clear and measurable.

3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - None identified. No overlapping time windows or contradictions present.

4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - None identified. No geographical conflicts detected.

5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The policy lacks specificity regarding the dataset being referenced. To improve clarity, it should explicitly define which dataset the images belong to.

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - Missing elements: Clear identification of the dataset from which the images are being viewed should be added.

7. **Conflict Issues:**
   - None identified. No logical contradictions present.

8. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - None identified. No hierarchy conflicts present.

9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - No critical issues. The policy does not use universal quantifiers and is reasonably enforceable.

## Decision
- **Status:** NEEDS REVISION
- **Rationale:** The policy is fundamentally sound but requires clarification on the specific dataset being referenced. 

## Improvement Suggestions
- Specify the dataset from which the images will be viewed in the policy statement. For example, the revised statement could read: "The Daten Raumkultur connector allows UC4 partners to view a maximum of 50 images per day from the [specific dataset name]. This restriction is in place to maintain limited access to the dataset." This amendment will address the completeness issue regarding asset identification and improve clarity for all stakeholders.
