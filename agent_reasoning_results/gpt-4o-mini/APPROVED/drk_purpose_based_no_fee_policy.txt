   - Need to ensure that the conditions for access do not create unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles or confusion over eligibility.

## Decision
- **Status**: NEEDS REVISION
- **Rationale**: The policy has moderate issues primarily concerning the lack of specificity about the target datasets and what constitutes "non-commercial marketing." Addressing these issues would improve clarity and applicability in real-world scenarios.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. Clearly list the specific "selected cultural datasets" that the policy refers to.
2. Provide a precise definition of "non-commercial marketing," outlining acceptable activities and examples to guide users in understanding permissible use.

By implementing these changes, the policy would become clearer and more effective, ensuring that users can engage with the datasets in a manner aligned with the institution's objectives.
