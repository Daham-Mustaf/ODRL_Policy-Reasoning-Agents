## Original Policy Statement
"The Daten Raumkultur project offered access to the 'UC4 Partner' dataset via the DRK Connector platform. Redistribution was only permitted before January 1, 2030, at 09:00:01. Furthermore, dataset access is restricted to users located within Germany."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Offer
- **Rule Type:** Permission
- **Actions:** 
  - Offered access to the 'UC4 Partner' dataset
  - Permitted redistribution of the dataset
- **Actors:**
  - **Assigner:** Daten Raumkultur project
  - **Assignee:** Not explicitly defined (implied to be users accessing the dataset)
- **Target Assets:** 'UC4 Partner' dataset

## Issues Detected
1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - None identified.

2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - Actions such as "offered access" and "redistribution" are vague. These terms do not specify definite parameters or conditions for access or redistribution, violating the requirement for measurable actions.

3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - The temporal constraint regarding redistribution is specific and does not conflict with other time periods.

4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No location hierarchies contradict as the policy mandates location within Germany.

5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The policy does not specify who the "users" are, requiring clarification on the target audience for access.

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - Missing explicit identification of all assets involved and clearer definitions for actions. It should clarify who exactly may exert the offered access.

7. **Conflict Issues:**
   - No conflicts identified.

8. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - None detected; although roles are implied, the hierarchy is not established clearly.

9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - The vague terminology ("offered access", "redistribution") undermines the policy's practicality in real-world application. It could lead to varied interpretations and challenges enforcing the rules effectively.

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED
- **Rationale:** The policy is rejected due to critical issues such as vague actions which cannot be measured or enforced, failing to define clear access and redistribution terms resulting in ambiguities that hinder implementation.

## Alternative Policy
"The Daten Raumkultur project provides defined access to the 'UC4 Partner' dataset via the DRK Connector platform for users specifically defined as researchers or institutions based in Germany. Redistribution of the dataset is only permitted until January 1, 2030, at 09:00:01, following a formal request process that must be documented and approved. This policy specifies that all users must verify their location within Germany via official documentation to gain access."

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Clarify Actions:** Define "offered access" and "redistribution" with specific criteria, outlining the process and conditions that must be satisfied for these actions.
2. **Specify Users:** Clearly identify the user base that is entitled to access the dataset, including their roles or affiliations.
3. **List Additional Assets:** Fully detail all datasets or documents included under this policy for clarity.
4. **Set Up a Request Process for Redistribution:** Outline a formal procedure for the redistribution of data to ensure accountability and track compliance.
