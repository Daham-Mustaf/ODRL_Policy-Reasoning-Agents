## Original Policy Statement
"The Münzkabinett museum provides access to a digital repository of ArchiveEvent. Users must register with a valid user ID, which can be either an ORCID or an email address, to access the repository. The policy ensures that only authenticated users can view and download the ArchiveEvent."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** Obligation
- **Actions:**
  - Register
  - View
  - Download
- **Actors:**
  - Assignee: Users
  - Assigner: Münzkabinett museum
- **Target Assets:**
  - ArchiveEvent (potentially referencing digital resources or archives)

## Issues Detected
1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - None identified.

2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - The action verbs "view" and "download" could be interpreted broadly and require further specificity on user roles or limits on data usage.

3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No temporal contradictions detected.

4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No location contradictions detected.

5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The policy does not specify what constitutes a “valid user ID” clearly; adding definition could improve clarity.

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - Missing explicit consequences for failing to register or for using an invalid identifier.
   - The asset identification could be more specific (e.g., defining "digital resources" or "archives").

7. **Conflict Issues:**
   - No other logical conflicts detected.

8. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - No hierarchy violations identified. 

9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - The policy can be implemented; however, it lacks clarity on the consequences of non-compliance and does not define the target assets adequately.

## Decision
- **Status:** NEEDS REVISION
- **Rationale:** The policy has moderate issues that can be addressed with specific changes, particularly in asset identification and clarity on compliance consequences.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Clarify Target Assets:**
   - Clearly define what constitutes "ArchiveEvent" and potentially include examples of digital resources that users can access.

2. **Define Valid User ID:**
   - Explicitly define what a “valid user ID” entails and possibly provide examples (e.g., acceptable formats for ORCID and email).

3. **Specify Actions:**
   - Consider detailing how "view" and "download" can be performed (e.g., restrictions on reuse of downloaded materials).

4. **Include Compliance Consequences:**
   - Outline what will happen if a user fails to register or provides invalid credentials (e.g., denial of access or suspension of rights).

5. **Add clarity on acceptable use:**
   - Specify whether there are any restrictions on viewing or downloading the ArchiveEvent, which can enhance the user understanding and observance of policy limits.
