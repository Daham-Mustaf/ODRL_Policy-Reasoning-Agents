9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - The policy could pose implementation challenges due to the vague phrase "officially registered participants." Clarity on the registration process is necessary to avoid confusion in enforcement.

## Decision
- Status: **NEEDS REVISION**
- Rationale: The policy requires specification of additional assets and a clearer description of the registration process for users to enhance its clarity and enforceability.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. Specify the process for becoming an "officially registered participant" to avoid ambiguity. This can include defining the criteria or steps needed for registration.
2. Include any additional assets that may be relevant to the dataset to ensure comprehensive understanding and clarity.
3. Consider adding contact information or resources for potential registrants to streamline their access process.
