## Original Policy Statement
"The Skulpturensammlung museum wants to provide public access to digital reproductions of the artwork 'Große Düne' by C. D. Friedrich. Museum Münzkabinett and are permitted to view and download digital images for sharing and non-commercial use."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type**: Agreement
- **Rule Type**: Permission
- **Actions**:
  - View digital images
  - Download digital images

- **Actors**:
  - Assignee: Museum Münzkabinett
  - Assigner: The Skulpturensammlung museum

## Issues Detected
1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**:
   - There are no non-measurable constraints identified, as all terms are precisely articulated.

2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**:
   - **Share** is a vague action. Without precise definitions regarding what sharing entails and under what conditions, it could lead to misuse or confusion about the extent of the permission. This violates the requirement for clear actionable terms.

3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**:
   - No temporal contradictions identified, as there are no conflicting time restrictions in the policy.

4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**:
   - No location contradictions identified; the policy does not mandate conflicting access rules based on geographical hierarchy.

5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision)**:
   - The term "sharing" needs definition to clarify what forms or methods of sharing are acceptable under the non-commercial use constraint.

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision)**:
   - The policy lacks specificity regarding the formats of digital images provided (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
   - It should specify the intended use case for sharing, for example, that it cannot be used for commercial marketing.

7. **Conflict Issues**:
   - No logical conflicts or contradictions were found within the identified terms.

8. **Hierarchy Violations**:
   - No hierarchy violations detected in terms of roles or locations.

9. **Real-world Implementation Issues**:
   - The policy is ambiguous regarding the act of sharing, which could complicate real-world enforcement, especially concerning non-commercial use. Lack of clarity around universal access and conditions for sharing could lead to complexities in implementation.

## Decision
- **Status**: NEEDS REVISION
- **Rationale**: The policy has a moderate issue with the vague action of "sharing" and lacks specifics on the target assets. These issues can be addressed by clarifying definitions and parameters, ensuring the policy can be effectively implemented and understood. 

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Define "Share"**: Explicitly state what sharing means, including any restrictions or acceptable methods of sharing digital images.
   
2. **Specify Formats**: Include the specific formats of the digital images that the Museum Münzkabinett can view and download (e.g., JPEG, PNG).

3. **Clarify Non-Commercial Use**: Elaborate on the conditions regarding what constitutes non-commercial use to avoid misunderstandings.

4. **Include Limitations**: While the policy allows for access, consider specifying any limitations on the number of images that can be downloaded or how they can be distributed.
