5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision)**:
   - The policy lacks specificity regarding which scholars can access the data (e.g., graduate, undergraduate).

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision)**:
   - The policy should specify eligibility criteria for scholars (e.g., type of academic involvement) or any limits on frequency or duration of access.

8. **Hierarchy Violations**:
   - None detected. Clear assignment to roles is evident.

9. **Real-world Implementation Issues**:

## Decision
- **Status**: NEEDS REVISION
- **Rationale**: The policy lacks clarity regarding which specific types of scholars can access the dataset. While there are no critical rejection issues, enhancing specificity will improve its clarity and applicability.

## Improvement Suggestions
- Specify the type of scholars eligible for access (e.g., undergraduate, graduate, or faculty).
- Consider including explicit guidelines or criteria for access, such as duration and frequency limits on dataset access for better implementation and management.
