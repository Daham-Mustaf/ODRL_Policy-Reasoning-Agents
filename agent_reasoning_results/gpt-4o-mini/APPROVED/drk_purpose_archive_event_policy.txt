---------------------------------------
## Original Policy Statement
"The Münzkabinett Museum permits access to specified datasets(ArchiveArtifact) only when the declared purpose is an instance of an ArchiveEvent."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** Permission
- **Actions:** Grant access to specified datasets
- **Actors:** No explicit assignee or assigner mentioned
- **Target Assets:** Specified datasets (ArchiveArtifact)

## Issues Detected
1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - **Non-Measurable Constraints:** The term "specified datasets" without clarification is non-measurable and leads to ambiguity.
     - Explanation: It does not specify which datasets are applicable, making it impossible to enforce or evaluate compliance.

2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - **Vague Action:** The action of "access" could be further clarified.
     - Explanation: Without specific criteria for what constitutes permitted access, it becomes unclear what actions are allowed or required.

3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No temporal contradictions have been identified.

4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No location hierarchy issues have been identified.

5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The reference to “specified datasets” is ambiguous.
     - **Recommendation:** Clearly define which datasets are included within "specified datasets."

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - Missing clear identification of specific datasets.
   - There are no clear activation conditions for permitted access.

7. **Conflict Issues:**
   - No conflicting rules or contradictory clauses identified.

8. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - No hierarchy violations identified.

9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - The lack of specificity in “specified datasets” makes practical implementation and enforcement challenging.
   - The policy does not contain universal quantifiers, but its ambiguity could lead to impractical scenarios.

## Decision
- **Status:** NEEDS REVISION
- **Rationale:** The policy requires clarification on what "specified datasets" are in order to ensure it is specific and measurable, which is essential for practical implementation. 

## Improvement Suggestions
- Revise the policy statement to explicitly enumerate the datasets permitted for access under the stated condition. Clarify the meaning of “access” to specify what that entails (e.g., viewing, downloading). Additionally, consider including criteria for defining an “ArchiveEvent” to ensure it is clear when access is permitted. 

**Revised Policy Example:**
"The Münzkabinett Museum permits access to the following specified datasets (e.g., coins, historical artifacts, documents) classified as ArchiveArtifact only when the declared purpose is an instance of an ArchiveEvent such as academic research, public exhibitions, or educational purposes."
