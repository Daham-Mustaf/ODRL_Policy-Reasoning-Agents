## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** Prohibition
- **Actions:** Use of the dataset
- **Actors:** Not explicitly defined (implies users of the dataset)
- **Target Assets:** The dataset 'OralTraditionsArchive'

## Issues Detected
1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - **Identified Non-Measurable Constraint:** The term "educational purposes" is vague and not explicitly defined.
     - **Explanation:** It could lead to different interpretations of what constitutes educational use, making it difficult to measure compliance.

2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - **Identified Vague Action:** The general action of "use" is not defined in a specific context.
     - **Explanation:** "Use" can encompass a wide array of activities without clear limits or definitions, which may create confusion or misuse.

3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No conflicting time windows were identified.

4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No location-specific constraints were identified.

5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The term "educational purposes" is vague. It could be specified or illustrated with examples of acceptable uses.
   - **Recommendation:** Include a clear definition or examples of educational use.

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - Additional clarity surrounding the term "educational purposes" is needed to avoid ambiguity.

7. **Conflict Issues:**
   - No logical conflicts were identified; however, clarification on the allowed usage is crucial to prevent misunderstandings.

8. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - No hierarchy violations were identified.

9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - The phrase "educational purposes" does not provide measurable criteria, which may hinder enforceability in a real-world context.
   - **CRITICAL CHECK:** The policy does not use universal quantifiers improperly but does lack specificity, which may lead to enforcement challenges.

## Decision
- **Status:** NEEDS REVISION
- **Rationale:** The policy lacks a clear definition of "educational purposes," which could lead to ambiguity and varying interpretations. This needs to be addressed to ensure consistent understanding and enforcement.

## Alternative Policy
"The dataset 'OralTraditionsArchive' may be used solely for educational purposes, defined as use in academic research, instruction, or learning activities. Commercial use of this dataset is strictly prohibited."

## Improvement Suggestions
- Provide clarity on what constitutes "educational purposes" by including examples or a detailed definition.
- Specify any limitations or conditions under educational use to enhance understanding and compliance.
