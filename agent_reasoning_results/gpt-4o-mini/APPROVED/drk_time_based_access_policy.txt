   - None identified.

2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - None identified.

3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No overlapping time windows as the time period is clearly specified. No contradictions detected.

4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No location requirements specified, hence no conflicts detected.

5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The term "Participants" is vague and needs clarification regarding who qualifies as "Participants."

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - Clear definitions of involved parties (who are the Participants) should be added to enhance clarity.

7. **Conflict Issues:**
   - No contradictory rules or logical conflicts identified.

8. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - No hierarchy violations detected.

9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - The policy could be improved with a more precise definition of "Participants."
   - No universal quantifiers noted that would complicate implementation.

## Decision
- **Status:** NEEDS REVISION
- **Rationale:** While the policy is mostly clear and implementable, it requires further specification regarding who the "Participants" are to improve understanding and compliance.

## Alternative Policy
(Since the policy is marked NEEDS REVISION, an alternative is not provided as it merely requires clarification.)

## Improvement Suggestions
1. Define "Participants" within the policy to clarify the individuals or roles allowed access to the dataset.
2. Consider specifying the process for how participants will be informed about their obligations in relation to the dataset.
