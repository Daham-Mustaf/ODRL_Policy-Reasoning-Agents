---------------------------------------

## Original Policy Statement
"Nobody can do anything."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Set
- Rule Type: Prohibition
- Actions: Not specified (vague)
- Actors: Not specified (vague)
- Target Assets: Not specified (vague)

## Issues Detected
1. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - The policy contains the vague action verb "anything" which is non-measurable and overly broad.
   - It does not specify any particular actions, making it impossible to enforce.

2. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - Missing explicit actions, actors, and target assets make the policy incomplete and impractical.

3. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - The policy is overly broad and impractical for enforcement in real-world scenarios.
   - Prohibiting any action by anybody is unrealistic and unenforceable.

## Decision
- Status: REJECTED
- Rationale: The policy statement is too vague, lacking specificity on actions, actors, and assets, making it impossible to implement in a practical setting.

## Alternative Policy
If the goal is to restrict specific actions, actors, or assets, a revised policy could be: "Unauthorized personnel are prohibited from accessing confidential data during non-business hours."

## Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly define specific actions, actors, and assets in the policy.
- Avoid using overly broad terms like "anybody" or "anything" to ensure clarity and enforceability.
