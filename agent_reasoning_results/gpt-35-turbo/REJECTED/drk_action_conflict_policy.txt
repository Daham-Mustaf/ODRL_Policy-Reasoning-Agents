## Original Policy Statement
Researchers can modify metadata in the Cultural Heritage Dataset for academic purposes. any metadata must not modify in the Cultural Heritage Dataset.

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Agreement
- Rule Type: Permission (Modify Metadata) and Prohibition (Modify Any Metadata)
- Actions: Modify metadata
- Actors: Researchers
- Target Assets: Cultural Heritage Dataset and its metadata

## Issues Detected
1. **Semantic Validation:**
   - **Action Conflict:** The policy allows and prohibits the same action on the same asset, creating a contradiction.

## Decision
- Status: REJECTED
- Rationale: The policy contains a fundamental semantic contradiction by allowing and prohibiting the same action on the same asset. This renders it unrealistic and unenforceable. The policy needs significant revision to align with coherent rules.

## Alternative Policy
Researchers can modify metadata in the Cultural Heritage Dataset for academic purposes. However, any modifications must adhere to the guidelines provided in the dataset's metadata modification policy.

## Improvement Suggestions
To enhance clarity and consistency:
- Define specific guidelines for metadata modification.
- Ensure internal consistency in rules regarding the modification of metadata.
- Clarify the distinction between permissible and prohibited modifications more explicitly.
