# Policy Analysis: drk_uc4_time_conflict

## Original Policy
The Daten Raumkultur project (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/) permits UC4 Partner to use the dataset (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234) only until January 1, 2025. However, the policy also allows UC4 Partner to access the dataset indefinitely, without an expiration date.

## Expected Decision
REJECTED

## LLM's Decision
REJECTED

## Manual Review
[ ] Correct (LLM matches expected)

---------------------------------------
## Original Policy Statement
The Daten Raumkultur project (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/) permits UC4 Partner to use the dataset (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234) only until January 1, 2025. However, the policy also allows UC4 Partner to access the dataset indefinitely, without an expiration date.

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Agreement
- Rule Type: Permission
- Actions: Use
- Actors: UC4 Partner
- Target Assets: Dataset identified as http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234

## Issues Detected
1. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - There is a conflicting temporal constraint where UC4 Partner is initially allowed to use the dataset until January 1, 2025, but later permitted indefinite access without an expiration date.
  
## Decision
- Status: REJECTED
- Rationale: The policy contains contradictory rules regarding the duration of UC4 Partner's access to the dataset, making it impractical and impossible to implement in a real-world scenario.

## Alternative Policy
As the policy is rejected, an alternative policy should be established. Here is a revised version:

**Revised Policy Statement:**
UC4 Partner is permitted to access and use the dataset (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234) indefinitely without any time constraints or expiration dates.

## Improvement Suggestions
