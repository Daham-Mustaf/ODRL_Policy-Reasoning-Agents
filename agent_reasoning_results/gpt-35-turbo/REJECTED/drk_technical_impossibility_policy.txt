# Policy Analysis: drk_technical_impossibility_policy

## Original Policy
All digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository must be simultaneously encrypted with AES-256 for security and stored as plaintext to enable full-text indexing. The system must maintain a single copy of each file that satisfies both requirements without any transformation during retrieval.

## Expected Decision
REJECTED

## LLM's Decision
NEEDS REVISION

## Manual Review
[ ] Correct (LLM matches expected)
[ ] Incorrect (LLM differs from expected)
[ ] Override to: _______________

## Original Policy Statement
"All digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository must be simultaneously encrypted with AES-256 for security and stored as plaintext to enable full-text indexing. The system must maintain a single copy of each file that satisfies both requirements without any transformation during retrieval."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Set
- Rule Type: Permission, Obligation
- Actions: Encrypt with AES-256, store as plaintext, maintain single unaltered copy
- Actors: The system
- Target Assets: Digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository

## Issues Detected
1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues:
   - None identified.

2. Vague Action Issues:
   - None identified.

3. Temporal Contradiction Issues:
   - No temporal constraints specified.

4. Location Hierarchy Issues:
   - No location hierarchy conflicts noted.

5. Ambiguity Issues:
   - Roles, assigner, assignee, and decision outcomes are ambiguous.

6. Completeness Issues:
   - Missing details on roles, assigner, assignee, and decision outcomes.

7. Conflict Issues:
   - No contradictions or conflicts found.

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - No hierarchy violations detected.

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - Feasible but lacks implementation details.
   - Needs clarification on encryption and storage management.

## Decision
- Status: NEEDS REVISION
- Rationale: The policy lacks clarity on roles, assigner, assignee, and decision outcomes. It needs to be revised with additional details for full implementation.

## Improvement Suggestions
- Define roles (assigner, assignee).
- Specify target assets (data, files).
- Detail decision outcomes post-action.
- Clarify how the encryption and storage management will be handled.
