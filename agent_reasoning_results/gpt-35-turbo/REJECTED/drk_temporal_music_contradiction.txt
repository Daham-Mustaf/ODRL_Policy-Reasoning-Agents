## Original Policy Statement
The track is available only after 2025, but it can also be used in 2024 for educational purposes.

## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Set
- Rule Type: Prohibition
- Actions: Use
- Actors: Not explicitly mentioned
- Target Assets: Not explicitly mentioned

## Issues Detected
1. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - The policy specifies conflicting timeframes for the availability of the track, creating a direct contradiction between 2024 and after 2025. This leads to a critical rejection trigger.

2. **Semantic Validation:**
   - Conflicting rules regarding the availability of the track in 2024 and after 2025 cause a semantic contradiction.

## Decision
- Status: REJECTED
- Rationale: The policy is rejected due to the semantic contradiction that makes implementation impossible.

## Alternative Policy
N/A

## Improvement Suggestions
N/A

Your analysis and reasoning:
The policy statement is rejected due to a fundamental contradiction in temporal constraints, making the policy unenforceable and logically unsound. It is imperative to ensure clarity and consistency in defining temporal constraints to avoid such critical issues in policy formulation.
