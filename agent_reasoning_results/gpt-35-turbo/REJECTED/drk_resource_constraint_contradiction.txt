5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
   - N/A

6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
   - N/A

7. Conflict Issues:
   - N/A

8. Hierarchy Violations:
   - N/A

9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
   - The policy sets a challenging technical standard that may be difficult to achieve on standard consumer hardware without dedicated GPUs. 


## Decision
- Status: APPROVED
- Rationale: The policy, while ambitious, does not contain critical rejection triggers. It sets a high standard for image processing within the repository, though its implementation may require significant optimizations.

## Improvement Suggestions
- Consider reviewing the required processing time and technical capabilities to align with practical constraints for standard consumer hardware. 

Your analysis and reasoning are sound. The policy is approved with the understanding that meeting its requirements may necessitate significant technical optimizations.
