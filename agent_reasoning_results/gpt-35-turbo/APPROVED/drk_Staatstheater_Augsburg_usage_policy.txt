## Policy Analysis Summary
- Policy Type: Set
- Rule Type: Permission
- Actions: Access
- Actors: Subscribers of Staatstheater_Augsburg, Culture Research Institute, Cultural Platform Bavaria
- Target Assets: Cultural assets accessed through the 'ShowTimesAPI'

## Issues Detected
1. Completeness Issues:
   - Missing Asset Identification: The policy does not clearly specify the target assets involved. It needs to be revised to include precise details to avoid ambiguity.

## Decision
- Status: NEEDS REVISION
- Rationale: The policy is clear and can be implemented, but it lacks specificity in defining the target assets. Adding a section to identify the exact cultural assets will enhance clarity and prevent misunderstandings.

## Improvement Suggestions
To improve the policy, a new section should be added to explicitly list the cultural assets covered by the 'ShowTimesAPI', such as event schedules, performance information, and related cultural data. This addition will enhance understanding and facilitate smoother implementation.
