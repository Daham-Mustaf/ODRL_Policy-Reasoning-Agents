# Policy Analysis: drk_technical_impossibility_policy

## Original Policy
All digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository must be simultaneously encrypted with AES-256 for security and stored as plaintext to enable full-text indexing. The system must maintain a single copy of each file that satisfies both requirements without any transformation during retrieval.

## Expected Decision

## Original Policy Statement
"All digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository must be simultaneously encrypted with AES-256 for security and stored as plaintext to enable full-text indexing. The system must maintain a single copy of each file that satisfies both requirements without any transformation during retrieval."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type**: Set
  - The policy defines obligations but does not directly assign them to specific parties, making it a "Set" policy type.
  
- **Rule Type**: Obligation
  - The policy uses "must," indicating actions that are mandatory and must be fulfilled.

- **Actions**:
  1. Encrypt all digital artifacts with AES-256.
  2. Store all digital artifacts in plaintext for indexing purposes.
  3. Maintain a single copy of the files that satisfies both encryption and plaintext requirements simultaneously.
  4. Prohibit any transformation during the retrieval process.

- **Actors**:
  - **Assigner**: Unspecified (likely the policy creators or administrators of the DRK Cultural Heritage repository).
  - **Assignee**: Unspecified (likely the implementation team or repository managers handling the system).

- **Target Assets**: Digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository.

## Issues Detected

### 1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **None detected.**
  - All constraints are measurable (e.g., "AES-256 encryption" is precise, "plaintext" is measurable).

---

### 2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **None detected.**
  - Actions such as "encrypt," "store," and "maintain" are sufficiently clear.

---

### 3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **None detected.**
  - The policy does not specify overlapping or conflicting timeframes.

---

### 4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **None detected.**
  - No location-specific rules are mentioned, so no conflicts exist.

---

### 5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision)
- **Actor Ambiguity**:
  - The policy does not specify who is responsible for implementing encryption, storage, and retrieval processes.
  - Recommendation: Clearly define the responsible actors (e.g., repository administrators, system teams).
  
---

### 6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision)
- **Activation Conditions and Timing**:
  - The policy does not specify when files must be encrypted and stored in plaintext (e.g., upon upload, after processing).
  - Recommendation: Add a trigger condition (e.g., "upon digitization" or "upon upload").

---

### 7. Conflict Issues

#### a. CRITICAL - Semantic Contradiction
- **Encryption vs. Plaintext Conflict**:
  - The policy requires digital artifacts to be "simultaneously encrypted with AES-256" and "stored as plaintext."
  - **Reason for Contradiction**: Encryption inherently transforms plaintext into ciphertext, making it impossible for files to simultaneously exist in plaintext without decryption.
  - **Result**: This creates a logical and technical conflict.

#### b. Prohibition of Transformation During Retrieval Aggravates the Conflict:
- Without any transformation allowed (e.g., decryption during retrieval), there is no mechanism to resolve the encryption vs. plaintext conflict during operations.

---

### 8. Hierarchy Violations
- **None detected.**
  - No hierarchical relationships (e.g., location or role-based) are specified.

---

### 9. Real-world Implementation Issues
- **Implementation Impossibility**:
  - Simultaneously fulfilling the requirements for AES-256 encryption and plaintext storage is a technical impossibility. Encryption fundamentally alters the file, and plaintext storage would directly violate the confidentiality provided by AES-256.

- **Practical Confusion**:
  - The prohibition against "transformation during retrieval" prevents dynamic decryption, rendering the system completely impractical for use.

- **Security Implications**:
  - Storing files in plaintext negates the benefits of AES-256 encryption, undermining data security and increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

---

## Decision
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Rationale**: 
  1. The policy contains a critical **semantic contradiction** by requiring simultaneous encryption and plaintext storage, which is both logically and technically impossible.
  2. The prohibition against transformation during retrieval eliminates potential workarounds, such as decrypting files temporarily for indexing.
  3. The policy is **technically infeasible** in a real-world setting and directly conflicts with basic principles of data security and operations.

---

## Alternative Policy
To resolve the issues and make the policy feasible, the following rewritten policy is recommended:

"All digital artifacts in the DRK Cultural Heritage repository must be securely stored in encrypted format using AES-256. To enable full-text indexing, the system must utilize mechanisms that dynamically decrypt files for indexing purposes only and ensure that plaintext content is never persistently stored. The repository must maintain a single encrypted copy of each file, and no unauthorized transformation of files may occur during retrieval."

### Improvements in the Alternative Policy:
1. **Eliminates Contradictions**:
   - Files are stored in encrypted format (security requirement) and dynamically decrypted only when necessary for indexing (indexing requirement), resolving the encryption vs. plaintext conflict.
2. **Allows Controlled Transformation**:
   - Dynamic decryption during indexing or retrieval addresses the "no transformation" issue while maintaining security.
3. **Clearer Implementation**:
   - The alternative policy aligns with standard practices, clearly specifying how encryption and indexing are achieved without persistent plaintext storage.

---

## Improvement Suggestions
For policies marked under **Needs Revision**:
1. Define activation conditions:
   - Specify when encryption/storage rules apply (e.g., "upon digitization" or "when uploaded to the repository").
2. Clarify actors:
   - Clearly specify who is responsible for enforcing encryption and indexing (e.g., repository administrators, system engineers).
3. Add flexibility for operational feasibility:
   - Allow necessary transformations, such as decryption, under controlled conditions to prevent technical conflicts.
