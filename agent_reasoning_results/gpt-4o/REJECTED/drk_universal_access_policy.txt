## Original Policy Statement
"Everyone can access everything."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** Permission
- **Actions:** Access
- **Actors:** 
  - **Assigner:** Not specified
  - **Assignee:** Everyone (undefined and overly broad)
- **Target Assets:** Everything (vague and undefined)

## Issues Detected

### 1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **Non-measurable Actors:**
  - "Everyone" is overly broad and does not specify who is included (e.g., employees, users, guests, etc.). This is non-measurable and fails to meet the requirement of defining specific assignees.
- **Non-measurable Assets:**
  - "Everything" lacks definition. It is impossible to determine what "everything" includes, making it non-measurable. For example, does this include sensitive data, confidential files, or private systems?

### 2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- No vague action issue detected; "access" is a specific and measurable action.

### 3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- No temporal constraints are specified. While this does not lead to a contradiction, the lack of specific time-based rules (e.g., "working hours," "within 30 days") results in high ambiguity.

### 4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- No location-based rules mentioned, but the complete lack of geography-scoping for access exacerbates the security risks.

### 5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision)
- **Actors:** "Everyone" is undefined, creating ambiguity about who can access the assets.
- **Assets:** "Everything" leaves open to interpretation what resources are includedâ€”physical resources, data, infrastructure, etc.

### 6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision)
- Missing elements:
  - No constraints (temporal, geographical, or role-based) to scope or limit applicability.
  - No definitions of activation conditions (e.g., "upon request," "after approval").
  - No assigner or activating party is explicitly defined.

### 7. Conflict Issues
- No direct conflicts detected, but the unrestricted nature of the policy inherently conflicts with standard security principles that require selective access controls.

### 8. Hierarchy Violations
- No explicit hierarchy violations detected, though the policy's universal scope ("Everyone can access everything") inherently dismisses all normal role-based, access-based, or location-based hierarchical distinctions.

### 9. Real-world Implementation Issues (CRITICAL)
- **Unrestricted Universal Access:**
  - Granting "everyone" access to "everything" is impractical and creates massive security, privacy, and compliance risks (e.g., sensitive data, internal systems, proprietary files).
- **Lack of Restrictions:**
  - The policy does not account for regulatory restrictions (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), organizational role-based access controls, or basic security principles like need-to-know or least privilege.
- **Impracticality:**
  - Allowing universal access without any constraints makes the policy effectively unenforceable and impractical in any real-world scenario.
  
## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED
- **Rationale:** The policy suffers from critical issues:
  - The use of universal quantifiers ("Everyone" and "everything") is undefined, unmeasurable, and non-specific, violating clear policy requirements.
  - The absence of constraints and scoping raises significant real-world security and privacy concerns.
  - It would be impossible to implement effectively without causing organizational harm.

## Alternative Policy
**Possible Rewritten Policy Statement:**
"Authorized users may access internal data files necessary for their role, subject to role-based access controls and explicit approvals by the system administrator."

### Key Changes:
1. **Actors:** Replace "Everyone" with "Authorized users."
2. **Assets:** Replace "Everything" with "internal data files necessary for their role."
3. **Constraints:** Add "role-based access controls" and systemic approvals to prevent access to irrelevant or sensitive data.
4. **Assigner:** Explicitly designate "system administrator" as the party responsible for defining approvals.
5. **Security:** Design the policy to align with standard security principles (e.g., least privilege, role-based access).

## Improvement Suggestions
If the original policy is to be revised, address the following points:
1. **Define Actors:** Specify who is covered under "Everyone" (e.g., "employees," "contractors," specific user roles).
2. **Clarify Assets:** Replace "Everything" with a list of specific, relevant assets ("customer data," "internal company files," "secure systems").
3. **Add Constraints:**
   - Temporal: Define when access is permitted (e.g., "business hours" or "on an as-needed basis").
   - Role-based: Limit access to specific roles or responsibilities.
   - Geographical: Restrict access geographically (e.g., "from within company premises").
4. **Incorporate Activation Conditions:** Specify under what circumstances access is granted (e.g., "upon manager approval," "with valid credentials").
5. **Ensure Practicality:** Align the policy with organizational security requirements, privacy laws, and operational feasibility.
