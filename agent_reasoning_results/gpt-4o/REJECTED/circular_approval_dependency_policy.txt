# Policy Analysis: circular_approval_dependency_policy

## Original Policy
External researchers may access the Historical Manuscripts Archive only after receiving approval from the Archives Committee. The Archives Committee may grant access only after reviewing the researcher's publication history, which must be verified by the Digital Rights Department. The Digital Rights Department may only perform verification after the researcher has been granted preliminary access to submit their credentials through the Archive Access Portal.

- **Rule Type:** Permission  
- **Actions:**  
  1. External researchers may request access to the archive.

  3. Digital Rights Department verifies the researcher's publication history.  
  4. External researchers submit their credentials via the Archive Access Portal.  

- **Actors:**  
  - Assignee(s): External researchers  
  - Assigner(s): Archives Committee, Digital Rights Department  

- **Target Assets:**  
  - Historical Manuscripts Archive  
  - Researcher's publication history  
  - Archive Access Portal

## Issues Detected

### 1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**  
   - None explicitly identified in the policy. All actions reference clear and measurable steps.

---

### 2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**  
   - None. Actions such as "review," "grant access," "verify," and "submit credentials" are clearly defined.

---

### 3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**  
   - **Identified Issue:** Circular dependency creates a temporal contradiction in the sequence of actions.  
     - **Problem:**  
       * The Digital Rights Department requires that the researcher has "preliminary access" to submit credentials before verification.  
       * However, preliminary access can only be granted *after* the verification is completed.  
     - **Impact:** This sequence creates a deadlock, as neither step can begin without the other.  

---

### 4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**  
   - None identified. No geographic or location-based conflicts are present within this policy.

---

### 5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision)**  
   - While the policy outlines roles and actions clearly, it is ambiguous about how preliminary access is granted without triggering the circular dependency.  
     - **Recommendation:** Clarify how "preliminary access" is defined and under what conditions it can be issued, if any.  

---

### 6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision)**  
   - The sequence of actions lacks a dedicated trigger or fallback mechanism to resolve the circular dependency.  
     - **Recommendation:** Introduce a step where researchers can submit credentials independently and explicitly prior to the granting of preliminary access.  

---

### 7. **Conflict Issues**  
   - **Circular Dependency (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGER):**  
     - The policy contains a loop where prerequisites are interdependent and cannot functionally resolve:  
       * A. Preliminary access requires verification →  
       * B. Verification requires credential submission →  
       * C. Credential submission requires preliminary access.  

     - **Result:** This circular dependency makes the policy impossible to implement as written.

---

### 8. **Hierarchy Violations**  
   - None identified. The roles of the Archives Committee and Digital Rights Department are distinct and non-overlapping.

---

### 9. **Real-World Implementation Issues**  
   - **Implementation Impossibility:**  
     - The circular dependency obstructs all paths forward, as no actor can take action without another actor completing a dependent action first.  
   - **Practicality:**  
     - Without resolving the deadlock, the policy cannot be applied in a real-world setting.  

---

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED  
- **Rationale:** Critical circular dependency makes the proposed process unworkable in its current form. This implementation impossibility cannot be resolved without significant restructuring of the policy.

---

## Alternative Policy
To address the circular dependency and provide a feasible sequence of actions, the policy can be restructured as follows:

"External researchers may access the Historical Manuscripts Archive only after receiving approval from the Archives Committee. Researchers must first submit their credentials through the Archive Access Portal for verification. The Digital Rights Department will perform verification of the researcher's credentials and publication history. Once verification is complete, the Archives Committee will review the report and may grant access to the requested materials."

### Key Changes:
1. Credentials are submitted through the Archive Access Portal *before* any verification occurs.  
2. The Digital Rights Department verifies credentials only after submission is complete.  
3. The Archives Committee grants access based on the verified report, avoiding the need for "preliminary access."

---

## Improvement Suggestions
If the policy is rewritten to address the identified issues, the following changes should be incorporated:

1. **Clarify Action Sequence:** Outline a step-by-step process that eliminates any circular dependencies. Develop triggers to enforce the correct sequence of activities.  
   - Example: Credentials must be submitted before any verification begins.  

2. **Remove Ambiguities:** Define what "credentials" entail and what specific information the Digital Rights Department requires for verification. Include deadlines and time frames, if applicable.  

3. **Avoid Redundant Steps:** "Preliminary access" may be an unnecessary concept; credentials submission can be allowed without requiring any prior approvals.  

By adopting these improvements, the policy can potentially be approved.
