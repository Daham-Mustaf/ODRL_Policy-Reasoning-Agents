# Policy Analysis: drk_role_conflict_policy

## Original Policy
Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted to all researchers for academic purposes. All managers must have full access to this dataset at all times to monitor research activities. All administrators are strictly prohibited from accessing this dataset under any circumstances. According to the organizational structure, all managers are also classified as administrators in the system.

## Expected Decision

## Original Policy Statement
"Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted to all researchers for academic purposes. All managers must have full access to this dataset at all times to monitor research activities. All administrators are strictly prohibited from accessing this dataset under any circumstances. According to the organizational structure, all managers are also classified as administrators in the system."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Set
- **Rule Type:** 
  - Permission (Researchers granted access)
  - Obligation (Managers must have access)
  - Prohibition (Administrators prohibited)
- **Actions:** Access the Cultural Heritage Dataset
- **Actors:**
  - Researchers (Permission)
  - Managers (Obligation)
  - Administrators (Prohibition)
- **Target Assets:** Cultural Heritage Dataset

## Issues Detected

1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - None identified; constraints are explicitly measurable.

2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - None identified; actions are clearly defined as "access."

3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - None identified; no temporal contradictions stated.

4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - None identified; no location-based hierarchies mentioned.

5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The statement could benefit from explicitly defining terms like "full access" and "all times" for clarity.

6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - Missing explicit definitions of conditions for access (e.g., specifying "academic purposes" more clearly).

7. **Conflict Issues:**
   - **Role Hierarchy Contradiction:** Managers, required to have access, are also classified as administrators, who are prohibited from access, causing a direct conflict.

8. **Hierarchy Violations:**
   - **Role-based Conflict:** Managers = Administrators. The policy requires managers (administrators) to have access, contradicting the prohibition of administrator access.

9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - Impossible to implement due to contradictory rules stating that managers must have access but are also prohibited as administrators.
   - Universal restriction on administrators without appropriate exceptions for managers.

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED
- **Rationale:** The policy contains semantic contradictions due to role hierarchy inconsistencies, leading to an impossible implementation scenario. Managers, classified as administrators, are both permitted and prohibited from accessing the dataset.

## Alternative Policy
Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted to eligible researchers for academic purposes. Managers are granted full access to this dataset for the purpose of monitoring research activities. Administrators, who have a role distinct from managerial positions, are prohibited from accessing this dataset to ensure compliance with organizational security protocols.

## Improvement Suggestions
None needed, since the alternative policy offers a complete rewrite to prevent contradiction.
