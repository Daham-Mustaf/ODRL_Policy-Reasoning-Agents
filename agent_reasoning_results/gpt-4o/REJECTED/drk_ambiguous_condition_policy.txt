## Original Policy Statement
"If researchers submit access requests for restricted manuscripts, then curators will review the request. If the request is approved, users can download high-resolution images. If the request is urgent, it will be expedited."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type**: Agreement  
  - An implied agreement between researchers (assignees) and curators (assigners) outlining submission, review, and approval conditions.  

- **Rule Type**:  
  - **Obligation**: Researchers must submit access requests.
  - **Obligation**: Curators are required to review the requests.
  - **Permission**: Users are allowed to download high-resolution images after approval.
  - **Obligation**: Urgent requests must be expedited.

- **Actions**:
  1. Researchers **submit access requests**.
  2. Curators **review the requests**.
  3. Curators **approve or deny** the requests.
  4. Users **download high-resolution images** if approved.
  5. Curators **expedite** requests marked as urgent.

- **Actors**:  
  - **Assignees**: Researchers (submitters of the requests).  
  - **Assigners**: Curators (reviewers and approvers of the requests).  

- **Target Assets**:  
  - **Restricted manuscripts** (implicit reference within context of access requests).  
  - **High-resolution images** (explicitly mentioned as downloadable resources after approval).

## Issues Detected

### 1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **"Urgent"** is a non-measurable term:
  - There is no clearly defined criterion or metric for determining what qualifies a request as "urgent."
  - This ambiguity makes determining when a request requires expedited review impossible.

- **"Expedited"** is a non-measurable term:
  - The policy does not specify what "expedited" means in practical terms (e.g., a measurable time frame or prioritization process).

**Reason for rejection**: Non-measurable terms such as "urgent" and "expedited" introduce critical implementation barriers, rendering the policy unclear and unenforceable.

---

### 2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- While the actions of "submit requests" and "review requests" are clear, the following issues are present:
  - The **action of "expediting" is vague** without further clarification about:
    - What the expedited process entails.
    - How it differs from standard review processes in terms of timeline and prioritization.
  - There is **no action defined for denied requests** (e.g., notifying requesters or providing feedback).

**Reason for rejection**: The vagueness of "expediting" violates clarity requirements, making the policy incomplete and impractical.

---

### 3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- There are **no explicit time frames** provided for any part of the review or approval process, and no measurable timelines for "expedited" versus standard procedures.  
- However, no direct temporal conflicts (e.g., overlapping contradictory time rules) are identified.

---

### 4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- No explicit locations or regional constraints are mentioned in the policy.  
- **No issues found for this category.**

---

### 5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision)
- **Vague target assets**:  
  - The term "restricted manuscripts" is not defined. Without clarification, it is unclear what qualifies a manuscript as "restricted" and how researchers identify those requiring access requests.

- **Approval conditions not specified**:  
  - The criteria curators use to approve or deny a request are not stated, leaving the decision-making process ambiguous.

---

### 6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision)
- **No handling procedure for denied requests**:  
  - The policy does not address what happens when a request is denied (e.g., whether users are notified, appeals are allowed, or the reasons are logged).
  
- **No process for non-urgent requests**:  
  - The policy does not specify a timeline or workflow for processing requests that are not marked as "urgent."

---

### 7. Conflict Issues  
- **Circular dependency check**:  
  - No circular dependencies identified (e.g., all actions follow a linear flow).  

- **Logical conflict check**:  
  - No direct logical contradictions found (e.g., permission/prohibition for the same action at the same time).  
  However, the lack of clarity in defining temporal priorities (e.g., determining “urgent” versus standard timelines) could lead to implementation challenges.

---

### 8. Hierarchy Violations
- No explicit hierarchy violations for locations or roles are identified.

---

### 9. Real-World Implementation Issues
- **Overuse of vague terms**:  
  - Terms like "urgent," "expedited," and "restricted manuscripts" are not clearly defined, making it impossible to implement the policy in real-world workflows.  

- **Incomplete process**:
  - The policy does not describe complete procedures for denied requests or delayed approvals.  
  - Missing time frames and prioritization criteria make enforcement inconsistent.  
  - Lack of clarity in defining "restricted manuscripts" results in scope issues, as curators and researchers may inconsistently interpret which materials require access requests.

---

## Decision
- **Status**: REJECTED  
- **Rationale**:  
  The policy contains multiple critical issues, including non-measurable temporal constraints, vague action definitions, incomplete decision paths, and unclear target assets. These shortcomings make the policy impractical and unenforceable in its current form.

---

## Alternative Policy
**Revised Policy Statement**:  
"Researchers may submit clearly defined access requests for manuscripts labeled as 'restricted access.' Restricted manuscripts refer to any unpublished or proprietary documents explicitly flagged by the repository as requiring individual permissions.  
Curators must review submitted requests within 5 business days. If approved, users (including researchers) may download high-resolution images of requested manuscripts through a secure link. Requests marked as 'urgent,' along with an accompanying justification, will be processed within 1 business day. Denied requests will prompt written feedback, including reasons for denial and optional resubmission procedures."  

---

## Improvement Suggestions
If the policy is marked as "Needs Revision," the following changes are suggested:
1. **Define key terms clearly**:  
   - Provide criteria for "urgent" requests (e.g., time-sensitive research deadlines).  
   - For "restricted manuscripts," state the specific criteria or label used to identify such materials.  

2. **Set measurable time frames**:  
   - Define review timelines for expedited and non-expedited requests. Example: "Standard reviews will be processed within 5 business days; expedited reviews will be prioritized within 1 business day."  

3. **Clarify workflows for denied or unresolved requests**:  
   - Provide explicit instructions for notifying researchers of a denial and offering a resubmission process if applicable.

4. **Specify approval criteria**:  
   - Clearly state what curators should consider when approving or denying requests (e.g., research justification, data sensitivity).  

5. **Enhance enforceability**:  
   - Add clear operational details to prevent vague or ambiguous interpretations (e.g., role-specific responsibilities, prioritization mechanisms).  

By incorporating these revisions, the policy could feasibly support a compliant ODRL (Open Digital Rights Language) implementation.
