## Original Policy Statement
"The track is available only after 2025, but it can also be used in 2024 for educational purposes."

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type**: Set
- **Rule Type**: 
  - Permission: "It can also be used in 2024 for educational purposes."
  - Prohibition: "The track is available only after 2025."
- **Actions**:
  - Being "available" (implying accessibility but not defined further).
  - "Used for educational purposes" (specific permission for a limited purpose in 2024).
- **Actors**:
  - Assignee: Unspecified (e.g., individuals, organizations, or educational institutions potentially involved in using the track).
  - Assigner: Unspecified (e.g., policymakers, authorities, or system owners granting availability and permissions).
- **Target Assets**: "The track" (ambiguously defined and needs clarification regarding its exact nature).

## Issues Detected

### 1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **None detected**: All temporal constraints ("2024" and "after 2025") are measurable. However, further issues with respect to contradictions render this policy invalid.

---

### 2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **"Available" is vague**: The term "available" is insufficiently detailed. Does it imply physical access, digital access, or something else? This lack of clarity could impact implementation.
  - **Reason for rejection**: Policies must define actions clearly to avoid ambiguity in enforceability.

---

### 3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **Direct contradiction between permissions and prohibitions**:
  - The track is stated to be "available only after 2025," which implies prohibition on its availability/accessibility in 2024.
  - Simultaneously, the track is permitted for educational use in 2024, directly violating its stated unavailability before 2025.
  - These conflicting time-based rules for the same asset create an irreconcilable logical contradiction.
  - **Critical example**:
    - Prohibition: Available "only after 2025" â†’ Implies January 1, 2026 onwards.
    - Permission: Use is explicitly allowed in 2024.
    - This overlap makes it impossible to comply with both rules simultaneously.
  - **Reason for rejection**: The policy is unimplementable due to temporal contradictions.

---

### 4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **None detected**: The policy does not specify any location-based constraints.

---

### 5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision)
- **Ambiguity in the asset description**: "The track" is unspecified. Is this a physical track (e.g., a racecourse, railway, etc.) or a digital/educational resource (e.g., audio track, lecture content)?
  - **Recommendation**: Clarify the nature of the asset to avoid misinterpretation.
- **Ambiguity in actors**: The policy does not identify who the assigner is (responsible authority) or the assignee (who is granted access or use).
  - **Recommendation**: Specify involved parties and their roles.

---

### 6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision)
- **No activation conditions or timelines for obligation**:
  - The policy lacks specificity on how the 2024 educational use occurs:
    - E.g., Who grants this permission?
    - Under what circumstances does educational use in 2024 happen?
  - Without clear conditions, implementation is incomplete and ambiguous.
  - **Recommendation**: Include explicit activation conditions and roles responsible for granting educational permissions in 2024.

---

### 7. Conflict Issues
- **Critical conflict: Temporal contradiction**:
  - Issues detailed in Section 3. This conflict renders the policy impossible to enforce. 
- **No circular dependencies detected**: Rules do not reference each other in an infinite loop.

---

### 8. Hierarchy Violations
- **None detected**: No location-based or role-based hierarchy conflicts exist.

---

### 9. Real-world Implementation Issues
- **Impossibility of Real-world Application**:
  - Permission of use in 2024 contradicts the prohibition of availability until after 2025, making compliance unmeasurable and infeasible.
  - The lack of defined parties (assigner/assignee) and clear asset identification further complicates real-world applicability.

## Decision
- **Status**: REJECTED
- **Rationale**:
  - The policy cannot be implemented in a real-world setting due to:
    1. **Temporal contradiction**: Rules for availability directly conflict with permissions for use.
    2. **Vague actions**: The term "available" lacks the specificity required for enforceability.
  - Both issues are critical rejection triggers as they violate core policy requirements.

---

## Alternative Policy
To resolve the identified issues, the policy could be rewritten as follows:

"From January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, the track can be used exclusively for educational purposes under supervised conditions. Beginning January 1, 2026, the track will be fully available for all permitted uses."

### Changes made:
1. **Temporal Contradiction Resolved**:
   - Permission for educational use in 2024 is clearly stated as a limited, supervised exception.
   - General availability is delayed until 2026, avoiding temporal overlap.
2. **Clarification of Time Windows**:
   - Exact date ranges are specified for use (2024) and availability (after 2025).
3. **Specificity in Actions and Roles**:
   - "Used exclusively for educational purposes under supervised conditions" specifies allowable action and limitations.
4. **Clear Asset Timeline**:
   - Distinct conditions for 2024 use versus post-2025 availability eliminate ambiguity.

---

## Improvement Suggestions
If the policy is revised instead of rejected, here are specific recommendations:
1. **Clarify the asset**:
   - Define "the track" explicitly to avoid misinterpretation.
   - E.g., "The track refers to the digital music/audio resource created for educational institutions."
2. **Define actors**:
   - Specify who manages access (assigner) and who may use the track during 2024 (assignee).
   - E.g., "Educational institutions, as authorized by the policy owner, may access the track for teaching purposes."
3. **Resolve temporal contradictions**:
   - Clearly define sequential access phases (e.g., limited educational use in 2024, full availability in 2026).
4. **Improve activation conditions**:
   - Include triggers or conditions for permissions. E.g., "Usage in 2024 requires prior approval from the assigner."
