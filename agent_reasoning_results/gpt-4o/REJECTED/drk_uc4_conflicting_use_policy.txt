# Policy Analysis: drk_uc4_conflicting_use_policy

## Original Policy
The Daten Raumkultur project (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/) offers a contract for accessing the dataset (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234), permitting the named UC4 Partner to use the dataset up to 30 times. However, the same policy also permits the UC4 Partner to access the dataset without any usage limitations.

## Expected Decision

## Original Policy Statement
"The Daten Raumkultur project (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/) offers a contract for accessing the dataset (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234), permitting the named UC4 Partner to use the dataset up to 30 times. However, the same policy also permits the UC4 Partner to access the dataset without any usage limitations."

## Policy Analysis Summary

### **Policy Type**
- **Type:** Agreement  
  The policy is a formal agreement between the Daten Raumkultur project and the UC4 Partner.

### **Rule Type**
- **Rule Types:** Permissions
  1. **First permission:** Allows the UC4 Partner to access the dataset up to 30 times.
  2. **Second permission:** Allows the UC4 Partner unlimited access to the dataset.

### **Actions**
- "Access the dataset" is the primary action identified.

### **Actors**
- **Assigner:** Daten Raumkultur project  
- **Assignee:** Named UC4 Partner

### **Target Assets**
- **Asset Identified:** Dataset: `http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234`

---

## Issues Detected

### 1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues
- **No non-measurable constraints identified.**  
  The use of "up to 30 times" and "unlimited access" is measurable and specific.

---

### 2. Vague Action Issues
- **No vague actions found.**  
  "Access the dataset" is a clear and identifiable action.

---

### 3. Temporal Contradiction Issues
- **No temporal constraints specified.**  
  No overlapping or conflicting time periods detected.

---

### 4. Location Hierarchy Issues
- **No location hierarchy violations detected.**  
  The policy does not involve location-based rules.

---

### 5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision)
- **Ambiguity in Actor Identification:**  
  The "named UC4 Partner" is vaguely defined. While it implies a specific entity, the lack of clarity introduces potential enforcement challenges. This warrants revision to explicitly identify the actor.

---

### 6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision)
- **Contradictory Permissions:**  
  - The policy simultaneously allows access "up to 30 times" and "without any usage limitations."
  - This creates logical and practical incompleteness in the decision path, as it is impossible to enforce both permissions simultaneously.

---

### 7. Conflict Issues
- **Critical Semantic Contradiction:**
  - Rule Conflict: The contradiction between "up to 30 times" and "without usage limitations" is irreconcilable.
  - This creates a logical error that makes the policy unenforceable.

---

### 8. Hierarchy Violations
- No hierarchy violations identified (e.g., role or location-based).

---

### 9. Real-world Implementation Issues
- **Infeasibility of Implementation:**  
  - The conflicting permissions make it unclear whether enforcement should restrict access to 30 instances or allow unlimited use.  
  - Such contradictions make the policy impractical and render enforcement impossible.

- **Practical Ambiguity in Actor Identification:**  
  - The vague term "named UC4 Partner" may lead to ambiguity in real-world application.

---

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED  
- **Rationale:**  
  1. **Critical semantic contradiction:** The permissions inherently conflict, making the policy impossible to enforce.  
  2. **Real-world inapplicability:** The policy fails practical implementation due to this conflict.  
  3. **Incomplete enforcement path:** It is unclear how to resolve the contradictory permissions.  
  4. **Vagueness in actor identification:** Although less critical, this ambiguity further complicates implementation.

---

## Alternative Policy
To address the issues, the following alternative policy is proposed:

"The Daten Raumkultur project (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/) offers a contract for accessing the dataset (http://w3id.org/drk/ontology/d1234). The named UC4 Partner is permitted to access the dataset up to 30 times over the duration of the contract."

**Improvements:**
1. Explicitly states a quantitative limit for access ("up to 30 times"), resolving the semantic contradiction.
2. Removes the "unlimited access" permission, which conflicted with the restricted usage rule.
3. Specifies a timeframe for the permission ("over the duration of the contract") to add temporal clarity.

---

## Improvement Suggestions
If revision is preferred over rejection, here are the recommendations:

1. Resolve the Contradiction:
   - Decide whether access should be quantitatively limited ("up to 30 times") or unlimited. Retain only one of the permissions to eliminate the irreconcilable conflict.

2. Specify the Actor:
   - Replace "named UC4 Partner" with a clear identifier for the actor (e.g., "UC4 Partner Organization XYZ").

3. Add Temporal Clarity:
   - If limits are imposed, specify the time period (e.g., "up to 30 times per month," or "up to 30 times during the contract duration") to avoid ambiguity.  

4. Confirm Implementability:
   - Test the revised policy against real-world scenarios to ensure it is enforceable and does not introduce unintended consequences.  

---

## Mandatory Validation Checklist
Before analysis closure:
1. **Non-measurable constraints detected?** No.  
2. **Vague actions detected?** No.  
3. **Logical contradictions detected?** Yes.  
4. **Real-world implementation issues?** Yes.  

Final decision to **reject** is consistent with these findings. The alternative policy proposal resolves the critical issues identified.
