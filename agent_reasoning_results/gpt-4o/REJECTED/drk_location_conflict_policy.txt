# Policy Analysis: drk_location_conflict_policy

## Original Policy
Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted exclusively within Germany, for approved researchers. However, access is prohibited in all locations outside of Germany, including all European countries. This creates a conflict as the dataset is accessible in Germany but completely restricted across Europe, which contradicts the expected availability within the European Union.

## Expected Decision

## Original Policy Statement
"Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted exclusively within Germany, for approved researchers. However, access is prohibited in all locations outside of Germany, including all European countries. This creates a conflict as the dataset is accessible in Germany but completely restricted across Europe, which contradicts the expected availability within the European Union."

## Issues Detected

### 1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **Non-measurable actor definition:**
  - "Approved researchers" is a vague term without clear criteria for approval, who does the approving, or methods of verification. This makes enforcement and implementation impossible.

### 2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- No vague action verbs were identified. "Access" is a clear and measurable action.

### 3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- No temporal constraints were mentioned; hence no temporal contradictions exist.

### 4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)
- **Hierarchy Conflict:**
  - The policy allows access within Germany but prohibits access in all European countries, which directly contradicts itself because Germany is a part of Europe. This creates an irreconcilable hierarchical conflict.

### 5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision)
- **Ambiguity in actor role:**
  - The term "approved researchers" lacks definition or context. It is unclear who qualifies as "approved."

### 6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision)
- The policy fails to sufficiently describe:
  - The process for granting access to "approved researchers."
  - The entity responsible for granting or enforcing provisions.
  - Clarifications regarding the scope of the prohibition for other European countries.

### 7. Conflict Issues
- **Semantic Contradiction:**
  - Permission to access in Germany contradicts the prohibition on access in all European countries.

### 8. Hierarchy Violations
- Geographical hierarchy violation:
  - Germany is a subset of Europe, and the policy creates contradictory rules by granting permission in Germany while prohibiting it in all European countries.

### 9. Real-world Implementation Issues
- **Impractical Enforcement:**
  - The contradiction between allowing access in Germany and prohibiting it in Europe makes real-world enforcement impossible.
- **Role ambiguity:** The lack of clarity around "approved researchers" results in an uncertain implementation framework.

---

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED
- **Rationale:**
  - The policy contains critical issues, including:
    1. **Geographical hierarchy conflicts** that make it logically invalid.
    2. **Vague role definition** for "approved researchers," making it non-measurable.
    3. **Semantic contradictions** that create confusion and impracticality for implementation.
  - These issues collectively trigger mandatory rejection under the outlined validation criteria.

## Alternative Policy
To allow the creation of a valid and enforceable policy, the following alternative could resolve the issues:

**Revised Policy Statement:**
"Access to the 'Cultural Heritage Dataset' is granted exclusively within Germany to researchers explicitly approved by the [responsible organization/assigner] through a formal application process. Access is prohibited in all locations outside Germany, with the exception of provisions made for data-sharing agreements with specific European Union member states. The scope of allowed access and approvals will be regularly reviewed and updated by the assigned governing body."

**Key Improvements:**
1. Resolved **geographical conflict** by clearly defining access within Germany and allowing for specific exemptions in the EU.
2. Added clear criteria for role definition through a formal approval process.
3. Eliminated semantic contradictions and made the policy feasible for real-world implementation.

---

## Improvement Suggestions
To address the policy issues without a complete rewrite, consider these revisions:
1. **Resolve Geographical Hierarchy Conflict:**
   - Replace "prohibited in all locations outside Germany, including all European countries" with a clear exception for Germanyâ€™s inclusion in Europe, e.g.,  
     - "Access is prohibited in all locations outside Germany, except for specific exemptions within Europe, as determined by [assigner/organization]."
2. **Define "Approved Researchers":**
   - Include measurable criteria, e.g.,  
     - "Approved researchers are individuals granted access following verification and approval by [assigner/organization] based on their research credentials and their submitted application."
3. **Clarify Enforcement Responsibilities:**
   - Explicitly state who and how access permissions and prohibitions will be enforced.
4. **Ensure Actionable Statements:**  
   - Remove vague expressions like "approved researchers" or provide sufficient definitions to make processing explicit and implementable.

By addressing these issues, the policy could move toward an approvable state suitable for use.
