## Original Policy Statement
"The Münzkabinett grants free access to selected cultural datasets only if the purpose of using the data is non-commercial marketing to enhance the institution's visibility."

---

## Policy Analysis Summary
- **Policy Type:** Offer
- **Rule Type:** Permission  
- **Actions:** Grant free access  
- **Actors:**  
  - Assigner: Münzkabinett  
  - Assignee: Not explicitly identified (assumed to be potential users or requesters of the datasets).  
- **Target Assets:** Selected cultural datasets  

---

## Issues Detected

### 1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - **"Enhance the institution's visibility"** is a non-measurable constraint.  
     - Explanation: The phrase lacks defined, measurable criteria for what constitutes "enhancing visibility." Without benchmarks or metrics, compliance cannot be evaluated.  
     - Violation: The vague condition makes enforcement impossible, as implementers cannot assess whether visibility has been enhanced.

---

### 2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No vague actions were detected.  

---

### 3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No temporal constraints or contradictions are present.

---

### 4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):**
   - No location-based constraints are defined, so no geographical hierarchy issues exist.

---

### 5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - The assignee is not explicitly identified (e.g., "any user," "researchers," "educators").  
     - Recommendation: Specify who qualifies for access (general public, institutions, researchers, etc.).
   - The target assets ("selected cultural datasets") are vague.  
     - Recommendation: Provide a list or clear criteria for identifying these datasets to prevent uncertainty.

---

### 6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):**
   - **Verification Mechanism Missing:**  
     The policy lacks a clear mechanism to verify that the assignee's purpose is genuinely "non-commercial marketing" and that it enhances visibility.  
     - Recommendation: Outline compliance evaluation steps, such as requesting documentation or proof of non-commercial use and visibility enhancement outcomes.
   - No conditions are stated for what happens if the assignee violates the purpose constraint.  
     - Recommendation: Include repercussions for misuse (e.g., revoking access or taking legal action).

---

### 7. **Conflict Issues:**  
   - No logical contradictions (e.g., conflicting permissions or prohibitions) are evident in this policy.

---

### 8. **Hierarchy Violations:**  
   - No role or location hierarchy violations were identified.

---

### 9. **Real-world Implementation Issues:**
   - **Enforcement Difficulty:**  
     The policy is difficult to implement in the absence of:
     1. Defined criteria for "enhancing visibility."  
     2. A process to review and approve requests based on non-commercial marketing purposes.  
   - **Impracticality Risks:**  
     Without a defined process, users could misuse the datasets for unintended purposes while claiming compliance, and the Münzkabinett would lack means to refute such claims.

---

## Decision
- **Status:** REJECTED
- **Rationale:**  
  The policy contains critical non-measurable constraints ("enhance the institution's visibility") and lacks clear compliance mechanisms. Without addressing these issues, the policy cannot ensure proper implementation or prevent misuse.  

---

## Alternative Policy
To address the issues with the original policy, an improved policy could be as follows:

"The Münzkabinett grants free access to a predefined list of selected cultural datasets for individuals or organizations solely for non-commercial marketing purposes. Such marketing activities must aim to promote the Münzkabinett by publicly acknowledging the institution and increasing engagement through measurable metrics such as website traffic, social media activity, or event attendance. Access will be granted upon submission of a formal request detailing the intended use, with supporting evidence required upon request. Münzkabinett reserves the right to revoke access if the terms are violated."

### Key Improvements:
1. **Measurable Purpose:**  
   - Replaced "enhance the institution's visibility" with concrete and measurable outcomes, such as increased website traffic or social media activity.  
2. **Defined Target Assets:**  
   - Included the requirement for a "predefined list of selected cultural datasets," reducing ambiguity.  
3. **Verification Mechanism:**  
   - Required users to submit a formal request specifying their intended use and introduced the possibility of requiring supporting evidence.  

---

## Improvement Suggestions
If the policy is to remain in its original form and marked as "NEEDS REVISION," the following changes would be essential:

### 1. Define Measurable Criteria for "Enhancing Visibility":
   - Provide specific metrics to evaluate the outcome, such as:
     - Number of website visits.
     - Social media engagement statistics (likes, shares, comments).  
     - Media mentions or articles featuring Münzkabinett.  

### 2. Specify Target Assets:
   - Replace "selected cultural datasets" with:  
     - A named list of datasets or a reference to their specific location (e.g., datasets cataloged on the Münzkabinett website or repository).  

### 3. Explicitly Identify the Eligible Assignees:
   - State who can request access (e.g., individuals, educational institutions, research organizations).

### 4. Add a Transparent Review and Verification Process:
   - Include procedures for submitting requests, evaluating compliance, and ensuring that users adhere to "non-commercial marketing" purposes.  
   - Suggestion: "Users must submit a marketing plan outlining their intended use and methods for promoting the Münzkabinett."

### 5. Include Terms for Non-Compliance:
   - Define consequences for violations, such as revoking access or imposing restrictions on future requests.

## Conclusion
**Mandatory Validation Checks:**
- Did you identify any non-measurable constraint? **YES** → REJECTED.  
- Did you identify any vague action? **NO** → Acceptable.  
- Did you identify any logical contradiction or implementation impossibility? **NO**.  

The policy is rejected because "enhance the institution’s visibility" constitutes a critical non-measurable constraint. The alternative policy provided corrects these shortcomings and ensures practical applicability.
