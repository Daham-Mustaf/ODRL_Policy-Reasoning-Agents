## Policy Analysis Summary

- **Policy Type**: Offer (implied permissions granted to specific actors, though assigner clarity is lacking)
- **Rule Type**: Permission
- **Actions**: 
  - View digital images
  - Download digital images
  - Share digital images (with the condition "non-commercial use")
- **Actors**: 
  - Assigner: "Skulpturensammlung museum" (implied but not explicitly structured as the grantor of permissions)
  - Assignee: "Museum Münzkabinett" (clearly stated in the policy)
  - "Public access" (vaguely implied without clarification)
- **Target Assets**: Digital reproductions of the artwork 'Große Düne' by C. D. Friedrich.

## Issues Detected

### 1. Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
- **No non-measurable constraints are detected**. Terms like "view," "download," and "non-commercial use" are measurable provided non-commercial use is clarified.

---

### 2. Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
- **No vague action issues are detected**. Actions (view, download, share) are measurable and specific.

---

### 3. Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
- **No temporal contradictions detected.** The policy does not include specific time windows, so no conflicts exist.

---

### 4. Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS):
- **No location hierarchy issues detected.** The policy does not specify location-based constraints or permissions.

---

### 5. Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision):
- **Public access is undefined**: The phrase "public access" is vague, as the policy does not clarify whether it includes individual members of the public, institutions, or specific museums beyond Museum Münzkabinett.
- **Non-commercial use is undefined**: The term "non-commercial use" lacks specificity, which could lead to ambiguous interpretation (e.g., does it include academic use, personal use, or use by nonprofits?).

---

### 6. Completeness Issues (May Require Revision):
- **Lack of attribution requirement for sharing**: The policy does not include obligations for providing credit to the original source (Skulpturensammlung museum or C. D. Friedrich).
- **Unaddressed public inclusion**: While "public access" is mentioned, the scope of access and permissible actions for the general public are not detailed.

---

### 7. Conflict Issues:
- **No logical conflicts or dependencies detected.** The stated permissions for Museum Münzkabinett do not contradict each other.

---

### 8. Hierarchy Violations:
- **No hierarchy violations detected.** There are no conflicting rules applied to overlapping actor or location hierarchies.

---

### 9. Real-world Implementation Issues:
- **Overly broad "sharing" permissions**: The policy permits sharing under "non-commercial use" without specifying potential limitations, creating challenges in enforcement (e.g., redistribution could occur without proper attribution or safeguards against unauthorized usage).
- **Undefined "public access" scope**: Without specifying which public users are granted access, implementing and securing this policy may be problematic in a real-world context.
  
---

## Decision
- **Status**: NEEDS REVISION
- **Rationale**: While the policy avoids rejection triggers (e.g., non-measurable constraints, vague actions, temporal or location-based contradictions), it requires revisions to clarify key terms and ensure enforceability.

---

## Alternative Policy (if REJECTED)
**Rewritten Alternative Policy:**
"The Skulpturensammlung museum grants Museum Münzkabinett and members of the general public permission to view, download, and share digital reproductions of the artwork 'Große Düne' by C. D. Friedrich for non-commercial use. Non-commercial use is defined as use that does not generate direct or indirect financial profits, including personal and educational purposes. Parties sharing the digital reproductions must provide proper attribution to both the artist (C. D. Friedrich) and Skulpturensammlung museum in all instances of use."

Rationale for Changes:
1. Explicitly defines non-commercial use to remove ambiguity.
2. Includes attribution requirements to preserve the museum's and artist's rights.
3. Clarifies public scope by explicitly stating that members of the general public are included.

---

## Improvement Suggestions (if NEEDS REVISION)
1. **Clarify Assigner and Assignee**:
   - State explicitly that "Skulpturensammlung museum" is the assigner granting permissions to the assignees, including Museum Münzkabinett and potentially the general public.

2. **Define Non-Commercial Use**:
   - Add specific criteria to define what constitutes "non-commercial use" (e.g., personal, educational, or nonprofit usage).

3. **Scope of Sharing**:
   - Clarify any obligations for sharing digital reproductions, such as a requirement for attribution (credit to the original source and artist) or restrictions on redistribution.

4. **Specify Public Access**:
   - Define whether "public access" includes the general public, specific institutions, or specific roles.

5. **Address Completeness**:
   - Address missing attribution requirements and define public inclusion to ensure enforceability and avoid ambiguity.

---

By incorporating these revisions, the policy can meet real-world implementation requirements and align with ODRL standards for clarity, enforceability, and specific rule definition.
