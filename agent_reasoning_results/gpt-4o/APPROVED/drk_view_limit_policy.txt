## Original Policy Statement
"The Daten Raumkultur connector allows UC4 partners to view a maximum of 50 images per day. This restriction is in place to maintain limited access to the dataset."

## Policy Analysis Summary

- **Policy Type:** Agreement  
  (The policy represents an agreement permitting specific actions under defined constraints.)  

- **Rule Type:** Permission  
  ("The Daten Raumkultur connector allows" implies explicit permission for certain actions.)

- **Actions:**  
  - "View" (explicit and measurable action)

- **Actors:**  
  - **Assignee (Who is allowed?):** UC4 partners (explicit reference to the target group)  
  - **Assigner (Who allows?):** Daten Raumkultur (implied as the responsible entity)

- **Target Assets:**  
  - "Images within the dataset accessed through the Daten Raumkultur connector"

## Issues Detected

### 1. **Non-Measurable Constraint Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**  
   - **None identified:** The policy uses a measurable constraint ("maximum of 50 images per day"), which is specific and clear.  

---

### 2. **Vague Action Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**  
   - **None identified:** The action "view" is concrete and unambiguous, with no vague verbs (e.g., "process", "manage") present.  

---

### 3. **Temporal Contradiction Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**  
   - **None identified:** The temporal limitation of "per day" is consistent and does not conflict with other time periods. No overlapping or contradictory time windows exist.  

---

### 4. **Location Hierarchy Issues (CRITICAL - REJECTION TRIGGERS)**  
   - **None identified:** No location-specific constraints or conflicts are present in the policy.  

---

### 5. **Ambiguity Issues (May Require Revision)**  
   - **Policy clarity:** The policy is clear regarding permissions (what is allowed), time constraints (daily), and the quantitative limit (50 images).  
   - **No ambiguities identified that would require revision.**

---

### 6. **Completeness Issues (May Require Revision)**  
   - **Assigner Explicitness:** The policy does not explicitly identify the assigner ("Daten Raumkultur" is implied, but not explicitly named as the responsible party).  
     - **Recommendation:** Include an explicit mention of the assigner to avoid potential ambiguity.  
       Example: "The Daten Raumkultur organization allows UC4 partners..."  

---

### 7. **Conflict Issues**
   - **None identified:** There are no logical or semantic conflicts in this policy.  

   - **Circular Dependency Check:** No circular dependencies are present (e.g., no recursive dependencies like "A requires B, B requires C, and C requires A").  

---

### 8. **Hierarchy Violations**
   - **None identified:** No hierarchical (geographic, organizational, or role-based) conflicts are present.  

---

### 9. **Real-world Implementation Issues**
   - **Implementation Feasibility:** The policy's restriction (50 images per day) is specific, implementable, and measurable within real-world systems.  
     - The policy does not overreach by granting universal or overly broad access.
     - No universal quantifiers (e.g., "everyone", "everything") are used.
   - **No security/privacy issues:** The policy aligns with good practices by limiting data exposure through quantitative and temporal constraints.  
   - **No unintended consequences detected:** The policy is pragmatic and enforceable with no obvious risks of misinterpretation or misuse.  

---

## Decision
- **Status:** APPROVED  
- **Rationale:** The policy is clearly written, specific, and implementable. It contains measurable constraints (50 images per day), clearly defines the target group (UC4 partners), and avoids ambiguities or contradictions. The lack of an explicitly named assigner (Daten Raumkultur) is a minor completeness issue that does not warrant rejection.

---

## Alternative Policy
(Not required, as the policy was approved.)

---

## Improvement Suggestions

If the assigner name is required to be explicit in the policy, the following improvement is recommended:  
**Revised policy:**  
"The Daten Raumkultur organization allows UC4 partners to view a maximum of 50 images per day using the Daten Raumkultur connector. This restriction is in place to maintain limited access to the dataset."  

This revision explicitly names the assigner ("Daten Raumkultur organization") to improve clarity.
